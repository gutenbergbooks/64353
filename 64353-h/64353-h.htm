<p class="noindent">Fourteen years have passed since the first edition of
this book was published, and in revising it for this new
edition I found at my disposal an immense mass of new
materials, statistical and descriptive, and a great number
of new works dealing with the different subjects
that are treated in this book. I have thus had an
excellent opportunity to verify how far the previsions
that I had formulated when I first wrote this book
have been confirmed by the subsequent economical
evolution of the different nations.</p>

<p>This verification permits me to affirm that the
economical tendencies that I had ventured to foreshadow
then have only become more and more definite
since. Everywhere we see the same decentralisation
of industries going on, new nations continually
entering the ranks of those which manufacture for the
world market. Each of these new-comers endeavours
to develop, and succeeds in developing, on its own
territory the principal industries, and thus frees itself
from being exploited by other nations, more advanced
in their technical evolution. All nations have made a
remarkable progress in this direction, as will be seen
from the new data that are given in this book.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one sees, with all the great
industrial nations, the growing tendency and need of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
developing at home a more intensive agricultural productivity,
either by improving the now existing
methods of extensive agriculture, by means of small
holdings, “inner colonisation,” agricultural education,
and co-operative work, or by introducing different new
branches of intensive agriculture. This country is
especially offering us at this moment a most instructive
example of a movement in the said direction. And
this movement will certainly result, not only in a
much-needed increase of the productive forces of the
nation, which will contribute to free it from the international
speculators in food produce, but also in
awakening in the nation a fuller appreciation of the
immense value of its soil, and the desire of repairing
the error that has been committed in leaving it in the
hands of great land-owners and of those who find it now
more advantageous to rent the land to be turned into
shooting preserves. The different steps that are
being taken now for raising English agriculture and
for obtaining from the land a much greater amount of
produce are briefly indicated in Chapter V.</p>

<p>It is especially in revising the chapters dealing with
the small industries that I had to incorporate the
results of a great number of new researches. In so
doing I was enabled to show that the growth of an
infinite variety of small enterprises by the side of the
very great centralised concerns is not showing any
signs of abatement. On the contrary, the distribution
of electrical motive power has given them a new
impulse. In those places where water power was
utilised for distributing electric power in the villages,
and in those cities where the machinery used for producing
electric light during the night hours was utilised
for supplying motive power during the day, the small
industries are taking a new development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span></p>

<p>In this domain I am enabled to add to the present
edition the interesting results of a work about the
small industries in the United Kingdom that I made
in 1900. Such a work was only possible when the
British Factory Inspectors had published (in 1898, in
virtue of the Factories Act of 1895) their first reports,
from which I could determine the hitherto unknown
numerical relations between the great and the small
industries in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Until then no figures whatever as regards the distribution
of operatives in the large and small factories
and workshops of Great Britain were available; so
that when economists spoke of the “unavoidable”
death of the small industries they merely expressed
hypotheses based upon a limited number of observations,
which were chiefly made upon part of the textile
industry and metallurgy. Only after Mr. Whitelegge
had published the first figures from which reliable
conclusions could be drawn was it possible to see
how little such wide-reaching conclusions were confirmed
by realities. In this country, as everywhere,
the small industries continue to exist, and new ones
continue to appear as a necessary growth, in many
important branches of national production, by the
side of the very great factories and huge centralised
works. So I add to the chapter on small industries
a summary of the work that I had published in the
<cite>Nineteenth Century</cite> upon this subject.</p>

<p>As regards France, the most interesting observations
made by M. Ardouin Dumazet during his many years’
travels all over the country give me the possibility
of showing the remarkable development of rural
industries, and the advantages which were taken
from them for recent developments in agriculture
and horticulture. Besides, the publication of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
statistical results of the French industrial census of
1896 permits me to give now, for France, most remarkable
numerical data, showing the real relative
importance of the great and the small industries.</p>

<p>And finally, the recent publication of the results of
the third industrial census made in Germany in 1907
gives me the data for showing how the German small
industries have been keeping their ground for the last
twenty-five years&mdash;a subject which I could touch only
in a general way in the first editions. The results of
this census, compared with the two preceding ones,
as also some of the conclusions arrived at by competent
German writers, are indicated in the Appendix.
So also the results recently arrived at in Switzerland
concerning its home industries.</p>

<p>As to the need, generally felt at this moment, of an
education which would combine a wide scientific instruction
with a sound knowledge of manual work&mdash;a
question which I treat in the last chapter&mdash;it can be
said that this cause has already been won in this
country during the last twenty years. The <em>principle</em>
is generally recognised by this time, although most
nations, impoverished as they are by their armaments,
are much too slow in applying the principle in life.</p>

<p class="noindent">Under the name of profits, rent, interest upon capital,
surplus value, and the like, economists have eagerly
discussed the benefits which the owners of land or
capital, or some privileged nations, can derive, either
from the underpaid work of the wage-labourer, or
from the inferior position of one class of the community
towards another class, or from the inferior
economical development of one nation towards another
nation. These profits being shared in a very unequal
proportion between the different individuals, classes
and nations engaged in production, considerable pains
were taken to study the present apportionment of the
benefits, and its economical and moral consequences, as
well as the changes in the present economical organisation
of society which might bring about a more equitable
distribution of a rapidly accumulating wealth. It is
upon questions relating to the right to that increment
of wealth that the hottest battles are now fought
between economists of different schools.</p>

<p>In the meantime the great question&mdash;“What have
we to produce, and how?” necessarily remained in the
background. Political economy, as it gradually emerges
from its semi-scientific stage, tends more and more to
become a science devoted to the study of the needs of
men and of the means of satisfying them with the
least possible waste of energy,&mdash;that is, a sort of
physiology of society. But few economists, as yet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
have recognised that this is the proper domain of
economics, and have attempted to treat their science
from this point of view. The main subject of social
economy&mdash;that is, the <em>economy of energy required for the
satisfaction of human needs</em>&mdash;is consequently the last
subject which one expects to find treated in a concrete
form in economical treatises.</p>

<p>The following pages are a contribution to a portion
of this vast subject. They contain a discussion of the
advantages which civilised societies could derive
from a combination of industrial pursuits with intensive
agriculture, and of brain work with manual
work.</p>

<p>The importance of such a combination has not
escaped the attention of a number of students of
social science. It was eagerly discussed some fifty
years ago under the names of “harmonised labour,”
“integral education,” and so on. It was pointed out
at that time that the greatest sum total of well-being
can be obtained when a variety of agricultural, industrial
and intellectual pursuits are combined in each
community; and that man shows his best when he is
in a position to apply his usually-varied capacities
to several pursuits in the farm, the workshop, the
factory, the study or the studio, instead of being
riveted for life to one of these pursuits only.</p>

<p>At a much more recent date, in the ’seventies,
Herbert Spencer’s theory of evolution gave origin in
Russia to a remarkable work, <cite>The Theory of Progress</cite>,
by M. M. Mikhailovsky. The part which belongs in
progressive evolution to <em>differentiation</em>, and the part
which belongs in it to an <em>integration</em> of aptitudes and
activities, were discussed by the Russian author with
depth of thought, and Spencer’s differentiation-formula
was accordingly completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span></p>

<p>And, finally, out of a number of smaller monographs,
I must mention a suggestive little book by
J. R. Dodge, the United States statistician (<cite>Farm and
Factory: Aids derived by Agriculture from Industries</cite>,
New York, 1886). The same question was discussed in
it from a practical American point of view.</p>

<p>Half a century ago a harmonious union between
agricultural and industrial pursuits, as also between
brain work and manual work, could only be a remote
desideratum. The conditions under which the factory
system asserted itself, as well as the obsolete forms
of agriculture which prevailed at that time, prevented
such a union from being feasible. Synthetic production
was impossible. However, the wonderful simplification
of the technical processes in both industry
and agriculture, partly due to an ever-increasing division
of labour&mdash;in analogy with what we see in biology&mdash;has
rendered the synthesis possible; and a distinct
tendency towards a synthesis of human activities becomes
now apparent in modern economical evolution.
This tendency is analysed in the subsequent chapters&mdash;a
special weight being laid upon the present possibilities
of agriculture, which are illustrated by a number of
examples borrowed from different countries, and upon
the small industries to which a new impetus is being
given by the new methods of transmission of motive
power.</p>

<p>The substance of these essays was published in
1888-1890 in the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>, and of one of
them in the <cite>Forum</cite>. However, the tendencies indicated
therein have been confirmed during the last ten years
by such a mass of evidence that a very considerable
amount of new matter had to be introduced, while
the chapters on agriculture and the small trades had
to be written anew.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">Who does not remember the remarkable
chapter by which Adam Smith opens his
inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth
of nations? Even those of our contemporary
economists who seldom revert to the works
of the father of political economy, and often
forget the ideas which inspired them, know
that chapter almost by heart, so often has it
been copied and recopied since. It has become
an article of faith; and the economical history
of the century which has elapsed since Adam
Smith wrote has been, so to speak, an actual
commentary upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p>“Division of labour” was its watchword.
And the division and subdivision&mdash;the permanent
subdivision&mdash;of functions has been
pushed so far as to divide humanity into castes
which are almost as firmly established as those
of old India. We have, first, the broad division
into producers and consumers: little-consuming
producers on the one hand, little-producing
consumers on the other hand. Then, amidst the
former, a series of further subdivisions: the
manual worker and the intellectual worker,
sharply separated from one another to the
detriment of both; the agricultural labourers
and the workers in the manufacture; and,
amidst the mass of the latter, numberless subdivisions
again&mdash;so minute, indeed, that the
modern ideal of a workman seems to be a man or
a woman, or even a girl or a boy, without the
knowledge of any handicraft, without any conception
whatever of the industry he or she is
employed in, who is only capable of making
all day long and for a whole life the same infinitesimal
part of something: who from the age of
thirteen to that of sixty pushes the coal cart at
a given spot of the mine or makes the spring
of a penknife, or “the eighteenth part of a pin.”
Mere servants to some machine of a given description;
mere flesh-and-bone parts of some
immense machinery; having no idea how and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
why the machinery performs its rhythmical
movements.</p>

<p>Skilled artisanship is being swept away as a
survival of a past condemned to disappear. The
artist who formerly found æsthetic enjoyment
in the work of his hands is substituted by the
human slave of an iron slave. Nay, even the
agricultural labourer, who formerly used to find
a relief from the hardships of his life in the home
of his ancestors&mdash;the future home of his children&mdash;in
his love of the field and in a keen intercourse
with nature, even he has been doomed
to disappear for the sake of division of labour.
He is an anachronism, we are told; he must be
substituted, in a Bonanza farm, by an occasional
servant hired for the summer, and discharged
as the autumn comes: a tramp who will
never again see the field he has harvested once
in his life. “An affair of a few years,” the
economists say, “to reform agriculture in
accordance with the true principles of division
of labour and modern industrial organisation.”</p>

<p>Dazzled with the results obtained by a century
of marvellous inventions, especially in England,
our economists and political men went still
farther in their dreams of division of labour.
They proclaimed the necessity of dividing the
whole of humanity into national workshops
having each of them its own speciality. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
were taught, for instance, that Hungary and
Russia are predestined by nature to grow
corn in order to feed the manufacturing countries;
that Britain had to provide the world-market
with cottons, iron goods, and coal;
Belgium with woollen cloth; and so on. Nay,
within each nation, each region had to have its
own speciality. So it has been for some time
since; so it ought to remain. Fortunes have
been made in this way, and will continue to be
made in the same way. It being proclaimed that
the wealth of nations is measured by the amount
of profits made by the few, and that the largest
profits are made by means of a specialisation of
labour, the question was not conceived to exist
as to whether human beings <em>would</em> always submit
to such a specialisation; whether nations
could be specialised like isolated workmen.
The theory was good for to-day&mdash;why should
we care for to-morrow? To-morrow might bring
its own theory!</p>

<p>And so it did. The narrow conception of life
which consisted in thinking that <em>profits</em> are the
only leading motive of human society, and
the stubborn view which supposes that what
has existed yesterday would last for ever,
proved in disaccordance with the tendencies
of human life; and life took another direction.
Nobody will deny the high pitch of production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
which may be attained by specialisation. But,
precisely in proportion as the work required from
the individual in modern production becomes
simpler and easier to be learned, and, therefore,
also more monotonous and wearisome&mdash;the
requirements of the individual for varying his
work, for exercising all his capacities, become more
and more prominent. Humanity perceives that
there is no advantage for the community in
riveting a human being for all his life to a
given spot, in a workshop or a mine; no gain in
depriving him of such work as would bring him
into free intercourse with nature, make of him a
conscious part of the grand whole, a partner in
the highest enjoyments of science and art, of
free work and creation.</p>

<p>Nations, too, refuse to be specialised. Each
nation is a compound aggregate of tastes and
inclinations, of wants and resources, of capacities
and inventive powers. The territory occupied
by each nation is in its turn a most varied texture
of soils and climates, of hills and valleys, of slopes
leading to a still greater variety of territories and
races. Variety is the distinctive feature, both
of the territory and its inhabitants; and that
variety implies a variety of occupations. Agriculture
calls manufactures into existence, and
manufactures support agriculture. Both are
inseparable; and the combination, the integra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>tion
of both brings about the grandest results.
In proportion as technical knowledge becomes
everybody’s virtual domain, in proportion as it
becomes international, and can be concealed
no longer, each nation acquires the possibility
of applying the whole variety of her energies
to the whole variety of industrial and agricultural
pursuits. Knowledge ignores artificial
political boundaries. So also do the industries;
and the present tendency of humanity is to have
the greatest possible variety of industries
gathered in each country, in each separate region,
side by side with agriculture. The needs of
human agglomerations correspond thus to the
needs of the individual; and while a <em>temporary</em>
division of functions remains the surest guarantee
of success in each separate undertaking, the
<em>permanent</em> division is doomed to disappear, and
to be substituted by a variety of pursuits&mdash;intellectual,
industrial, and agricultural&mdash;corresponding
to the different capacities of the
individual, as well as to the variety of capacities
within every human aggregate.</p>

<p>When we thus revert from the scholastics of
our text-books, and examine human life as a
whole, we soon discover that, while all the
benefits of a temporary division of labour must
be maintained, it is high time to claim those of
the <em>integration of labour</em>. Political economy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
has hitherto insisted chiefly upon <em>division</em>. We
proclaim <em>integration</em>; and we maintain that the
ideal of society&mdash;that is, the state towards
which society is already marching&mdash;is a society
of integrated, combined labour. A society where
each individual is a producer of both manual
and intellectual work; where each able-bodied
human being is a worker, and where each
worker works both in the field and the industrial
workshop; where every aggregation of individuals,
large enough to dispose of a certain variety
of natural resources&mdash;it may be a nation, or rather
a region&mdash;produces and itself consumes most of
its own agricultural and manufactured produce.</p>

<p>Of course, as long as society remains organised
so as to permit the owners of the land and capital
to appropriate for themselves, under the protection
of the State and historical rights, the
yearly surplus of human production, no such
change can be thoroughly accomplished. But
the present industrial system, based upon a
permanent specialisation of functions, already
bears in itself the germs of its proper ruin. The
industrial crises, which grow more acute and protracted,
and are rendered still worse and still
more acute by the armaments and wars implied
by the present system, are rendering its maintenance
more and more difficult. Moreover,
the workers plainly manifest their intention to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
support no longer patiently the misery occasioned
by each crisis. And each crisis accelerates
the day when the present institutions of individual
property and production will be shaken to
their foundations with such internal struggles
as will depend upon the more or less good sense
of the now privileged classes.</p>

<p>But we maintain also that any socialist attempt
at remodelling the present relations between
Capital and Labour will be a failure, if it does not
take into account the above tendencies towards
integration. These tendencies have not yet
received, in our opinion, due attention from
the different socialist schools&mdash;but they must.
A reorganised society will have to abandon the
fallacy of nations specialised for the production
of either agricultural or manufactured produce.
It will have to rely on itself for the production
of food and many, if not most, of the raw
materials; it must find the best means of combining
agriculture with manufacture&mdash;the work
in the field with a decentralised industry; and it
will have to provide for “integrated education,”
which education alone, by teaching both science
and handicraft from earliest childhood, can give
to society the men and women it really needs.</p>

<p>Each nation&mdash;her own agriculturist and
manufacturer; each individual working in the
field and in some industrial art; each individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
combining scientific knowledge with the knowledge
of a handicraft&mdash;such is, we affirm, the
present tendency of civilised nations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prodigious growth of industries in Great
Britain, and the simultaneous development of the
international traffic which now permits the transport
of raw materials and articles of food on a
gigantic scale, have created the impression that
a few nations of West Europe were destined to
become <em>the</em> manufacturers of the world. They
need only&mdash;it was argued&mdash;to supply the market
with manufactured goods, and they will draw
from all over the surface of the earth the food
they cannot grow themselves, as well as the raw
materials they need for their manufactures. The
steadily increasing speed of trans-oceanic communications
and the steadily increasing facilities
of shipping have contributed to enforce
the above impression. If we take the enthusiastic
pictures of international traffic, drawn
in such a masterly way by Neumann Spallart&mdash;the
statistician and almost the poet of the
world-trade&mdash;we are inclined indeed to fall
into ecstasy before the results achieved. “Why
shall we grow corn, rear oxen and sheep, and
cultivate orchards, go through the painful
work of the labourer and the farmer, and
anxiously watch the sky in fear of a bad crop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
when we can get, with much less pain, mountains
of corn from India, America, Hungary, or
Russia, meat from New Zealand, vegetables
from the Azores, apples from Canada, grapes
from Malaga, and so on?” exclaim the West
Europeans. “Already now,” they say, “our
food consists, even in modest households, of
produce gathered from all over the globe. Our
cloth is made out of fibres grown and wool
sheared in all parts of the world. The prairies
of America and Australia; the mountains and
steppes of Asia; the frozen wildernesses of the
Arctic regions; the deserts of Africa and the
depths of the oceans; the tropics and the lands
of the midnight sun are our tributaries. All races
of men contribute their share in supplying us
with our staple food and luxuries, with plain
clothing and fancy dress, while we are sending
them in exchange the produce of our higher intelligence,
our technical knowledge, our powerful
industrial and commercial organising capacities!
Is it not a grand sight, this busy and intricate
exchange of produce all over the earth which
has suddenly grown up within a few years?”</p>

<p>Grand it may be, but is it not a mere nightmare?
Is it necessary? At what cost has it
been obtained, and how long will it last?</p>

<p>Let us turn a hundred years back. France
lay bleeding at the end of the Napoleonic wars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Her young industry, which had begun to grow
by the end of the 18th century, was crushed
down. Germany, Italy were powerless in the
industrial field. The armies of the great Republic
had struck a mortal blow to serfdom on the
Continent; but with the return of reaction
efforts were made to revive the decaying institution,
and serfdom meant no industry worth
speaking of. The terrible wars between France
and England, which wars are often explained
by merely political causes, had a much deeper
meaning&mdash;an economical meaning. They were
wars for the supremacy on the world market,
wars against French industry and commerce,
supported by a strong navy which France had
begun to build&mdash;and Britain won the battle. She
became supreme on the seas. Bordeaux was no
more a rival to London; as to the French industries,
they seemed to be killed in the bud. And,
aided by the powerful impulse given to natural
sciences and technology by a great era of inventions,
finding no serious competitors in Europe,
Britain began to develop her manufactures.
To produce on a large scale in immense quantities
became the watchword. The necessary
human forces were at hand in the peasantry,
partly driven by force from the land, partly
attracted to the cities by high wages. The
necessary machinery was created, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
British production of manufactured goods went
on at a gigantic pace. In the course of less
than seventy years&mdash;from 1810 to 1878&mdash;the
output of coal grew from 10 to 133,000,000
tons; the imports of raw materials rose from
30 to 380,000,000 tons; and the exports of
manufactured goods from 46 to 200,000,000
pounds. The tonnage of the commercial fleet
was nearly trebled. Fifteen thousand miles of
railways were built.</p>

<p>It is useless to repeat now at what a cost
the above results were achieved. The terrible
revelations of the parliamentary commissions
of 1840-1842 as to the atrocious condition of
the manufacturing classes, the tales of “cleared
estates,” and kidnapped children are still
fresh in the memory. They will remain standing
monuments for showing by what means the
great industry was implanted in this country.
But the accumulation of wealth in the hands
of the privileged classes was going on at a speed
never dreamed of before. The incredible riches
which now astonish the foreigner in the private
houses of England were accumulated during
that period; the exceedingly expensive standard
of life which makes a person considered rich on
the Continent appear as only of modest means
in Britain was introduced during that time.
The taxed property alone doubled during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
last thirty years of the above period, while
during the same years (1810 to 1878) no less
than £1,112,000,000&mdash;nearly £2,000,000,000 by
this time&mdash;was invested by English capitalists
either in foreign industries or in foreign loans.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>But the monopoly of industrial production
could not remain with England for ever. Neither
industrial knowledge nor enterprise could be
kept for ever as a privilege of these islands.
Necessarily, fatally, they began to cross the
Channel and spread over the Continent. The
Great Revolution had created in France a
numerous class of peasant proprietors, who
enjoyed nearly half a century of a comparative
well-being, or, at least, of a guaranteed labour.
The ranks of homeless town workers increased
slowly. But the middle-class revolution of 1789-1793
had already made a distinction between
the peasant householders and the village <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prolétaires</i>,
and, by favouring the former to the
detriment of the latter, it compelled the labourers
who had no household nor land to abandon
their villages, and thus to form the first
nucleus of working classes given up to the mercy
of manufacturers. Moreover, the peasant-proprietors
themselves, after having enjoyed a
period of undeniable prosperity, began in their
turn to feel the pressure of bad times, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
children were compelled to look for employment
in manufactures. Wars and revolution had
checked the growth of industry; but it began
to grow again during the second half of our
century; it developed, it improved; and now,
notwithstanding the loss of Alsace, France is no
longer the tributary to England for manufactured
produce which she was sixty years ago. To-day
her exports of manufactured goods are valued at
nearly one-half of those of Great Britain, and
two-thirds of them are textiles; while her
imports of the same consist chiefly of the finer
sorts of cotton and woollen yarn&mdash;partly re-exported
as stuffs&mdash;and a small quantity of
woollen goods. For her own consumption
France shows a decided tendency towards becoming
entirely a self-supporting country, and
for the sale of her manufactured goods she is
tending to rely, not on her colonies, but especially
on her own wealthy home market.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Germany follows the same lines. During the
last fifty years, and especially since the last war,
her industry has undergone a thorough re-organisation.
Her population having rapidly
increased from forty to sixty millions, this
increment went entirely to increase the urban
population&mdash;without taking hands from agriculture&mdash;and
in the cities it went to increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the population engaged in industry. Her industrial
machinery has been thoroughly improved,
and her new-born manufactures are supplied
now with a machinery which mostly represents
the last word of technical progress. She has
plenty of workmen and technologists endowed
with a superior technical and scientific education;
and in an army of learned chemists,
physicists and engineers her industry has a most
powerful and intelligent aid, both for directly
improving it and for spreading in the country
serious scientific and technical knowledge. As
a whole, Germany offers now the spectacle of
a nation in a period of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aufschwung</i>, of a sudden
development, with all the forces of a new
start in every domain of life. Fifty years
ago she was a customer to England. Now she
is already a competitor in the European and
Asiatic markets, and at the present speedy rate
of growth of her industries, her competition will
soon be felt even more acutely than it is already
felt.</p>

<p>At the same time the wave of industrial production,
after having had its origin in the north-west
of Europe, spreads towards the east and
south-east, always covering a wider circle.
And, in proportion as it advances east, and
penetrates into younger countries, it implants
there all the improvements due to a century of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
mechanical and chemical inventions; it borrows
from science all the help that science can
give to industry; and it finds populations eager
to grasp the last results of modern knowledge.
The new manufactures of Germany begin
where Manchester arrived after a century of
experiments and gropings; and Russia begins
where Manchester and Saxony have now reached.
Russia, in her turn, tries to emancipate herself
from her dependency upon Western Europe,
and rapidly begins to manufacture all those
goods she formerly used to import, either from
Britain or from Germany.</p>

<p>Protective duties may, perhaps, sometimes
help the birth of new industries: always at the
expense of some other growing industries, and
always checking the improvement of those
which already exist; but the decentralisation of
manufactures goes on with or without protective
duties&mdash;I should even say, notwithstanding
the protective duties. Austria, Hungary
and Italy follow the same lines&mdash;they develop
their home industries&mdash;and even Spain and
Servia are going to join the family of manufacturing
nations. Nay, even India, even Brazil
and Mexico, supported by English, French, and
German capital and knowledge, begin to start
home industries on their respective soils. Finally,
a terrible competitor to all European<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
manufacturing countries has grown up of late in
the United States. In proportion as technical
education spreads more and more widely, manufactures
grow in the States; and they do grow
at such a speed&mdash;an American speed&mdash;that in a
very few years the now neutral markets will be
invaded by American goods.</p>

<p>The monopoly of the first comers on the
industrial field has ceased to exist. And it will
exist no more, whatever may be the spasmodic
efforts made to return to a state of things already
belonging to the domain of history. New ways,
new issues must be looked for: the past <em>has</em>
lived, and it will live no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before going farther, let me illustrate the
march of industries towards the east by a few
figures. And, to begin with, let me take the
example of Russia. Not because I know it
better, but because Russia is one of the latest
comers on the industrial field. Fifty years ago
she was considered as the ideal of an agricultural
nation, doomed by nature itself to supply other
nations with food, and to draw her manufactured
goods from the west. So it was,
indeed&mdash;but it is so no more.</p>

<p>In 1861&mdash;the year of the emancipation of the
serfs&mdash;Russia and Poland had only 14,060 manufactories,
which produced every year the value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
of 296,000,000 roubles (about £36,000,000).
Twenty years later the number of establishments
rose to 35,160, and their yearly production became
nearly four times the above, <em>i.e.</em>, 1,305,000,000
roubles (about £131,000,000); and in 1894,
although the census left the smaller manufactures
and all the industries which pay excise
duties (sugar, spirits, matches) out of account,
the aggregate production in the Empire reached
already 1,759,000,000 roubles, <em>i.e.</em>, £180,000,000.
The most noteworthy feature of this increase
is, that while the number of workmen employed
in the manufactures has not even doubled since
1861 (it attained 1,555,000 in 1894, and 1,902,750
in 1910), the production per workman has more
than trebled in the leading industries. The
average was less than £70 per annum in 1861;
it reaches now £219. The increase of production
is thus chiefly due to the improvement of
machinery.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>If we take, however, separate branches, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
especially the textile industries and the machinery
works, the progress appears still more striking.
Thus, if we consider the eighteen years which
preceded 1879 (when the import duties were
increased by nearly 30 per cent. and a protective
policy was definitely adopted), we find that
even without protective duties the bulk of
production in cottons increased three times,
while the number of workers employed in that
industry rose by only 25 per cent. The yearly
production of each worker had thus grown
from £45 to £117. During the next nine years
(1880-1889) the yearly returns were more than
doubled, attaining the respectable figure of
£49,000,000 in money and 3,200,000 cwts. in
bulk. Since that time, from 1890 to 1900, it
has doubled once more, the quantity of raw
cotton worked in the Russian factories having
increased from 255,000 to 520,700 cwts., and the
number of spindles having grown from 3,457,000
to 6,646,000 in 1900, and to 8,306,000 in 1910. It
must also be remarked that, with a population of
165,000,000 inhabitants, the home market for
Russian cottons is almost unlimited; while
some cottons are also exported to Persia and
Central Asia.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<p>True, that the finest sorts of yarn, as well as
sewing cotton, have still to be imported. But
Lancashire manufacturers will soon see to that;
they now plant their mills in Russia. Two large
mills for spinning the finest sorts of cotton yarn
were opened in Russia in 1897, with the aid of
English capital and English engineers, and a
factory for making thin wire for cotton-carding
has lately been opened at Moscow by a well-known
Manchester manufacturer. Several more
have followed since. Capital is international and,
protection or no protection, it crosses the frontiers.</p>

<p>The same is true of woollens. In this branch
Russia was for a certain time relatively backward.
However, wool-combing, spinning and
weaving mills, provided with the best modern
plant, were built every year in Russia and
Poland by English, German and Belgian mill-owners;
so that now four-fifths of the ordinary
wool, and as much of the finer sorts obtainable
in Russia, are combed and spun at home&mdash;one
fifth part only of each being sent abroad. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
times when Russia was known as an exporter
of raw wool are thus irretrievably gone.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In machinery works no comparison can even
be made between nowadays and 1861, or even
1870. Thanks to English and French engineers
to begin with, and afterwards to technical progress
within the country itself, Russia needs no
longer to import any part of her railway plant.
And as to agricultural machinery, we know, from
several British Consular reports, that Russian
reapers and ploughs successfully compete with
the same implements of both American and
English make. During the years 1880 to 1890,
this branch of manufactures has largely developed
in the Southern Urals (as a village industry,
brought into existence by the Krasnoufimsk
Technical School of the local District Council, or
<em>zemstvo</em>), and especially on the plains sloping
towards the Sea of Azov. About this last
region Vice-Consul Green reported, in 1894, as
follows: “Besides some eight or ten factories
of importance,” he wrote, “the whole of the
consular district is now studded with small
engineering works, engaged chiefly in the manufacture
of agricultural machines and implements,
most of them having their own foundries....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
The town of Berdyansk,” he added, “can now
boast of the largest reaper manufactory in Europe,
capable of turning out three thousand
machines annually.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Let me add that the above-mentioned figures,
including only those manufactures which show
a yearly return of more than £200, do not include
the immense variety of domestic trades which
also have considerably grown of late, side by
side with the manufactures. The domestic
industries&mdash;so characteristic of Russia, and so
necessary under her climate&mdash;occupy now more
than 7,500,000 peasants, and their aggregate
production was estimated a few years ago at
more than the aggregate production of all the
manufactures. It exceeded £180,000,000 per
annum. I shall have an occasion to return later
on to this subject, so that I shall be sober of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
figures, and merely say that even in the chief
manufacturing provinces of Russia round about
Moscow domestic weaving&mdash;for the trade&mdash;shows
a yearly return of £4,500,000; and that
even in Northern Caucasia, where the petty
trades are of a recent origin, there are, in the
peasants’ houses, 45,000 looms showing a yearly
production of £200,000.</p>

<p>As to the mining industries, notwithstanding
over-protection, and notwithstanding the competition
of fuelwood and naphtha,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the output
of the coal mines of Russia has doubled during
the years 1896-1904, and in Poland it has increased
fourfold.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Nearly all steel, three-quarters
of the iron, and two-thirds of the pig-iron used
in Russia are home produce, and the eight
Russian works for the manufacture of steel rails
are strong enough to throw on the market
over 10,000,000 cwts. of rails every year
(10,068,000 cwts. in 1910).<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is no wonder, therefore, that the imports
of manufactured goods into Russia are so insignificant,
and that since 1870&mdash;that is, nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
years before the general increase of duties&mdash;the
proportion of manufactured goods to the aggregate
imports has been on a steady decrease.
Manufactured goods make now only one-fifth of
the imports, and only occasionally rise to one-third,
as was the case in 1910&mdash;a year of maximal
imports. Besides, while the imports of Britain
into Russia were valued at £16,300,000 in 1872,
they were only £6,884,500 to £11,320,000 in the
years 1894 to 1909. Out of them, manufactured
goods were valued at a little more than £2,000,000&mdash;the
remainder being either articles of food or
raw and half-manufactured goods (metals, yarn
and so on). They reached £15,300,000 in 1910&mdash;a
year of maximum, and consisted chiefly of
machinery and coal. In fact, the imports of
British home produce have declined in the course
of ten years from £8,800,000 to £5,000,000, so as
to reduce in 1910 the value of British manufactured
goods imported into Russia to the following
trifling items: machinery, £1,320,000; cottons
and cotton yarn, £360,000; woollens and woollen
yarn, £480,000; chemical produce, £476,000;
and so on. But the depreciation of British
goods imported into Russia is still more striking.
Thus, in 1876 Russia imported 8,000,000 cwts. of
British metals, and they were paid £6,000,000;
but in 1884, although the same quantity was
imported, the amount paid was only £3,400,000.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
And the same depreciation is seen for all imported
goods, although not always in the same
proportion.</p>

<p>It would be a gross error to imagine that the
decline of foreign imports is mainly due to high
protective duties. The decline of imports is
much better explained by the growth of home
industries. The protective duties have no doubt
contributed (together with other causes) towards
attracting German and English manufacturers
to Poland and Russia. Lodz&mdash;the Manchester
of Poland&mdash;is quite a German city, and the
Russian trade directories are full of English and
German names. English and German capitalists,
English engineers and foremen, have planted
within Russia the improved cotton manufactures
of their mother countries; they are busy now
in improving the woollen industries and the
production of machinery; while Belgians have
rapidly created a great iron industry in South
Russia. There is now not the slightest doubt&mdash;and
this opinion is shared, not only by economists,
but also by several Russian manufacturers&mdash;that
a free-trade policy would not check the
further growth of industries in Russia. It would
only reduce the high profits of those manufacturers
who do not improve their factories
and chiefly rely upon cheap labour and long
hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<p>Moreover, as soon as Russia succeeds in
obtaining more freedom, a further growth of her
industries will immediately follow. Technical
education&mdash;which, strange to say, was for a long
time systematically suppressed by the Government&mdash;would
rapidly grow and spread; and in
a few years, with her natural resources and her
laborious youth, which even now tries to combine
workmanship with science, Russia would
see her industrial powers increase tenfold.
She <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">farà da sè</i> in the industrial field. She will
manufacture all she needs; and yet she will
remain an agricultural nation.</p>

<p>At the present time only a little more than
1,500,000 men and women, out of the 112,000,000
strong population of European Russia, work in
manufactures, and 7,500,000 combine agriculture
with manufacturing. This figure may
treble without Russia ceasing to be an agricultural
nation; but if it be trebled, there will
be no room for imported manufactured goods,
because an agricultural country can produce
them cheaper than those countries which live
on imported food. Let us not forget that in the
United Kingdom 1,087,200 persons, all taken, are
employed in <em>all</em> the textile industries of England,
Scotland, Ireland and Wales, and that <em>only</em>
300,000 out of them are males above eighteen
years of age (311,000 in 1907); that these work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>people
keep going 53,000,000 spindles and more
than 700,000 looms in the cotton factories only;
and that the yearly production of textiles during
the last few years was so formidable that it
represented a value of £200,000,000, and that the
average value of textiles exported every year
attained £136,257,500 in 1905-1910&mdash;to say
nothing of the £163,400,000 reached in the
extraordinary year of 1911.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same is still more true with regard to
other European nations, much more advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
in their industrial development, and especially
with regard to Germany. So much has been
written about the competition which Germany
offers to British trade, even in the British markets,
and so much can be learned about it from
a mere inspection of the London shops, that I
need not enter into lengthy details. Several
articles in reviews; the correspondence exchanged
on the subject in <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite>
in August, 1886; numerous consular reports,
regularly summed up in the leading newspapers,
and still more impressive when consulted in
originals; and, finally, political speeches, have
familiarised the public opinion of this country
with the importance and the powers of German
competition.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Moreover, the forces which German
industry borrows from the technical training
of her workmen, engineers and numerous
scientific men, have been so often discussed by
the promoters of technical education in England
that the sudden growth of Germany as an industrial
power can be denied no more.</p>

<p>Where half a century was required in olden
times to develop an industry, a few years are
sufficient now. In the year 1864 only 160,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
cwts. of raw cotton were imported into Germany,
and only 16,000 cwts. of cotton goods were exported;
cotton spinning and weaving were
mostly insignificant home industries. Twenty
years later the imports of raw cotton were already
3,600,000 cwts., and in another twenty
years they rose to 7,400,000 cwts.; while the
exports of cottons and yarn, which were valued
at £3,600,000 in 1883, and £7,662,000 in 1893,
attained £19,000,000 in 1905. A great industry
was thus created in less than thirty years, and
has been growing since. The necessary technical
skill was developed, and at the present time
Germany remains tributary to Lancashire for
the finest sorts of yarn only. However, it is
very probable that even this disadvantage will
soon be equalised.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Very fine spinning mills
have lately been erected, and the emancipation
from Liverpool, by means of a cotton exchange
established at Bremen, is in fair progress.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In the woollen trade we see the same rapid
increase, and in 1910 the value of the exports
of woollen goods attained £13,152,500 (against
£8,220,300 in 1894), out of which £1,799,000
worth were sent on the average to the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Kingdom during the years 1906-1910.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The
flax industry has grown at a still speedier rate,
and as regards silks Germany is second only to
France.</p>

<p>The progress realised in the German chemical
trade is well known, and it is only too badly felt
in Scotland and Northumberland; while the
reports on the German iron and steel industries
which one finds in the publications of the Iron
and Steel Institute and in the inquiry which
was made by the British Iron Trade Association
show how formidably the production of pig-iron
and of finished iron has grown in Germany since
1871. (See <a href="#APP_D">Appendix D</a>.) No wonder that the
imports of iron and steel into Germany were
reduced by one-half during the twenty years,
1874-1894, while the exports grew nearly four
times. As to the machinery works, if the Germans
have committed the error of too slavishly
copying English patterns, instead of taking a
new departure, and of creating new patterns, as
the Americans did, we must still recognise that
their copies are good and that they very
successfully compete in cheapness with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
tools and machinery produced in this country.
(See <a href="#APP_E">Appendix E</a>.) I hardly need mention the
superior make of German scientific apparatus.
It is well known to scientific men, even in France.</p>

<p>In consequence of the above, the imports of
manufactured goods into Germany are, as a
rule, in decline. The aggregate imports of textiles
(inclusive of yarn) stand so low as to be compensated
by nearly equal values of exports. And
there is no doubt that not only the German
markets for textiles will be soon lost for other
manufacturing countries, but that German
competition will be felt stronger and stronger
both in the neutral markets and those of Western
Europe. One can easily win applause from
uninformed auditories by exclaiming with more
or less pathos that German produce can <em>never</em>
equal the English! The fact is, that it competes
in cheapness, and sometimes also&mdash;where it is
needed&mdash;in an equally good workmanship;
and this circumstance is due to many causes.</p>

<p>The “cheap labour” cause, so often alluded
to in discussions about “German competition,”
which take place in this country and in France,
must be dismissed by this time, since it has
been well proved by so many recent investigations
that low wages and long hours do not
necessarily mean cheap produce. Cheap labour
and protection simply mean the possibility for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
a number of employers to continue working
with obsolete and bad machinery; but in
highly developed staple industries, such as the
cotton and the iron industries, the cheapest produce
is obtained with high wages, short hours
and the best machinery. When the number of
operatives which is required for each 1000
spindles can vary from seventeen (in many
Russian factories) to three (in England), and
when one weaver can look either after twenty
Northrop machine-looms, as we see it in the
United States, or after two machine-looms
only, as it is the case in backward mills, then
it is evident that no reduction of wages can
compensate for that immense difference. Consequently,
in the best German cotton mills and
ironworks the wages of the worker (we know
it directly for the ironworks from the above-mentioned
inquiry of the British Iron Trade
Association) are not lower than they are in
Great Britain. All that can be said is, that
the worker in Germany gets more for his wages
than he gets in this country&mdash;the paradise of the
middleman&mdash;a paradise which it will remain so
long as it lives chiefly on imported food produce.</p>

<p>The chief reason for the successes of Germany
in the industrial field is the same as it is for the
United States. Both countries have only lately
entered the industrial phase of their development,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
and they have entered it with all the energy
of youth. Both countries enjoy a widely-spread
scientifically-technical&mdash;or, at least, concrete
scientific&mdash;education. In both countries
manufactories are built according to the newest
and best models which have been worked out
elsewhere; and both countries are in a period
of awakening in all branches of activity&mdash;literature
and science, industry and commerce.
They enter now on the same phase in which
Great Britain was in the first half of the nineteenth
century, when British workers took such
a large part in the invention of the wonderful
modern machinery.</p>

<p>We have simply before us a fact of <em>the consecutive
development of nations</em>. And instead of
decrying or opposing it, it would be much
better to see whether the two pioneers of the
great industry&mdash;Britain and France&mdash;cannot
take a new initiative and do something new
again; whether an issue for the creative genius
of these two nations must not be sought for in a
new direction&mdash;namely, the utilisation of both
the land and the industrial powers of man for
securing well-being to the whole nation instead
of to the few.</p>

were uncertain. It appeared, however, in 1910, that there
were in the empire, including the industries paying an excise
duty, 19,983 establishments, employing 2,253,790 persons,
and showing a yearly production of 4,565,400,000 roubles
(£494,600,000). Out of them, the industrial establishments
under the factory inspectors in European Russia proper,
Poland, and the four northern provinces of Caucasia numbered
15,720, employing 1,951,955 workpeople, out of whom
1,227,360 were men, 521,236 women, and 203,359 children.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> The yearly imports of raw cotton from Central Asia and
Transcaucasia represent, as a rule, about one-tenth part of
the total imports of raw cotton (£1,086,000, as against £11,923,000
in 1910). They are quite a recent growth, the first plantations
of the American cotton tree having been introduced in Turkestan
by the Russians, as well as the first sorting and pressing
establishments. The relative cheapness of the plain cottons
in Russia, and the good qualities of the printed cottons,
attracted the attention of the British Commissioner at the
Nijni Novgorod Exhibition in 1897, and are spoken of at some
length in his report.</p>

1894: “Reapers of a special type, sold at £15 to £17, are
durable and go through more work than either the English
or the American reapers.” In the year 1893, 20,000 reaping
machines, 50,000 ploughs, and so on, were sold in that district
only, representing a value of £822,000. Were it not for the
simply prohibitive duties imposed upon foreign pig-iron (two
and a half times its price in the London market), this industry
would have taken a still greater development. But in order
to protect the home iron industry&mdash;which consequently continued
to cling to obsolete forms in the Urals&mdash;a duty of 61s.
a ton of imported pig-iron was levied. The consequences of this
policy for Russian agriculture, railways and State’s budget
have been discussed in full in a work by A. A. Radzig, <cite>The

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> Here are the figures obtained by the official census of
1908. In all the cotton industry, only 220,563 men (including
boys), 262,245 women, and 90,061 girls less than eighteen
years old were employed. They produced 6,417,798,000 yards
of unbleached gray, and 611,824,000 yards of bleached white
and coloured cottons&mdash;that is, 160 yards per head of population&mdash;and
1,507,381,000 lb. of yarn, valued £96,000,000. We
have thus 12,271 yards of cotton, and 2,631 lb. of yarn per person
of workpeople employed. For woollens and worsted there were
112,438 men and boys, 111,492 women, and 34,087 girls under
eighteen. The value (incomplete) of the woven goods was
about £40,250,000, and that of the yarn about £21,000,000.
These figures are most instructive, as they show how much
man can produce with the present machinery. Unfortunately,
the real productivity in a modern factory is not yet understood
by the economists. Thus, we saw lately Russian economists
very seriously maintaining that it was necessary to “proletarize”
the peasants (about 100,000,000) in order to create a
great industry. We see now that if one-fourth, or even one-fifth,
part only of the yearly increase of the population took to
industry (as it has done in Germany), Russian factories would
soon produce such quantities of all sorts of manufactured goods,
that they would be able to supply with them 400 or 500
million people, in addition to the population of the Russian
Empire.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">The flow of industrial growths spreads, however,
not only east; it moves also south-east
and south. Austria and Hungary are rapidly
gaining ground in the race for industrial importance.
The Triple Alliance has already
been menaced by the growing tendency of
Austrian manufacturers to protect themselves
against German competition; and even the
dual monarchy has seen its two sister nations
quarrelling about customs duties. Austrian
industries are a modern growth, and still they
already give occupation to more than 4,000,000
workpeople.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Bohemia, in a few decades, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
grown to be an industrial country of considerable
importance; and the excellence and originality
of the machinery used in the newly reformed
flour-mills of Hungary show that the young
industry of Hungary is on the right road, not
only to become a competitor to her elder sisters,
but also to add her share to our knowledge as to
the use of the forces of nature. Let me add,
by the way, that the same is true to some extent
with regard to Finland. Figures are wanting as
to the present state of the aggregate industries
of Austria-Hungary; but the relatively low
imports of manufactured goods are worthy of
note. For British manufacturers Austria-Hungary
is, in fact, no customer worth speaking
of; but even with regard to Germany she is
rapidly emancipating herself from her former
dependence. (See <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a>.)</p>

<p>The same industrial progress extends over
the southern peninsulas. Who would have
spoken in 1859 about Italian manufactures?
And yet&mdash;the Turin Exhibition of 1884 has
shown it&mdash;Italy ranks already among the manufacturing
countries. “You see everywhere a
considerable industrial and commercial effort
made,” wrote a French economist to the <cite>Temps</cite>.
“Italy aspires to go on without foreign produce.
The patriotic watchword is, Italy all by herself.
It inspires the whole mass of producers. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
is not a single manufacturer or tradesman who,
even in the most trifling circumstances, does
not do his best to emancipate himself from
foreign guardianship.” The best French and
English patterns are imitated and improved by
a touch of national genius and artistic traditions.
Complete statistics are wanting, so that the
statistical <cite>Annuario</cite> resorts to indirect indications.
But the rapid increase of imports of coal
(9,339,000 tons in 1910, as against 779,000 tons
in 1871); the growth of the mining industries,
which have trebled their production during
the fifteen years, 1870 to 1885; the increasing
production of steel and machinery (£4,800,000
in 1900), which&mdash;to use Bovio’s words&mdash;shows
how a country having no fuel nor minerals of
her own can have nevertheless a notable metallurgical
industry; and, finally, the growth of
textile industries disclosed by the net imports
of raw cottons and the number of spindles<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;all
these show that the tendency towards becoming
a manufacturing country capable of
satisfying her needs by her own manufactures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
is not a mere dream. As to the efforts made for
taking a more lively part in the trade of the
world, who does not know the traditional
capacities of the Italians in that direction?</p>

<p>I ought also to mention Spain, whose textile
mining and metallurgical industries are rapidly
growing; but I hasten to go over to countries
which a few years ago were considered as eternal
and obligatory customers to the manufacturing
nations of Western Europe. Let us take, for
instance, Brazil. Was it not doomed by economists
to grow cotton, to export it in a raw state,
and to receive cotton goods in exchange? In
1870 its nine miserable cotton mills could boast
only of an aggregate of 385 spindles. But
already in 1887 there were in Brazil 46 cotton
mills, and five of them had already 40,000 spindles;
while altogether their nearly 10,000 looms
threw every year on the Brazilian markets more
than 33,000,000 yards of cotton stuffs.</p>

<p>Twenty five years later, in 1912, there were
already 161 cotton mills, with 1,500,000 spindles
and 50,000 looms, employing over 100,000
operatives.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Even Vera Cruz, in Mexico,
under the protection of customs officers, has
begun to manufacture cottons, and boasted in
1887 its 40,200 spindles, 287,700 pieces of cotton
cloth, and 212,000 lb. of yarn. Since that year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
progress has been steady, and in 1894 Vice-Consul
Chapman reported that some of the finest
machines are to be found at the Orizaba spinning
mills, while “cotton prints,” he wrote, “are
now turned out as good if not superior to the
imported article.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In 1910, 32,000 workpeople
were already employed in 145 cotton mills,
which had 703,000 spindles, and 25,000 power-looms.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The flattest contradiction to the export theory
has, however, been given by India. She was
always considered as the surest customer for
British cottons, and so she has been until quite
lately. Out of the total of cotton goods exported
from Britain she used to buy more than one-quarter,
very nearly one-third (from £17,000,000
to £22,000,000, out of an aggregate of about
£75,000,000 in the years 1880-1890). But things
have begun to change, and in 1904-1907 the
exports were only from £21,680,000 to £25,680,000
out of an aggregate of £110,440,000. The
Indian cotton manufactures, which&mdash;for some
causes not fully explained&mdash;were so unsuccessful
at their beginnings, suddenly took firm root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<p>In 1860 they consumed only 23,000,000 lb.
of raw cotton, but the quantity was nearly four
times as much in 1877, and it trebled again within
the next ten years: 283,000,000 lb. of raw
cotton were used in 1887-1888. The number of
cotton mills grew up from 40 in 1887 to 147
in 1895; the number of spindles rose from
886,100 to 3,844,300 in the same years; and
where 57,188 workers were employed in 1887,
we found, seven years later, 146,240 operatives.
And now, in 1909-1910, we find 237 cotton mills
at work, with 6,136,000 spindles, 80,000 looms,
and 231,850 workpeople. As for the quality of
the mills, the blue-books praise them; the
German chambers of commerce state that the
best spinning mills in Bombay “do not now
stand far behind the best German ones”; and
two great authorities in the cotton industry,
Mr. James Platt and Mr. Henry Lee, agree in
saying “that in no other country of the earth
except in Lancashire do the operatives possess
such a natural leaning to the textile industry as
in India.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The exports of cotton twist from India more
than doubled in five years (1882-1887), and
already in 1887 we could read in the <cite>Statement</cite>
(p. 62) that “what cotton twist was imported
was less and less of the coarser and even medium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
kind, which indicates that the Indian (spinning)
mills are gradually gaining hold of the home
markets.” Consequently, while India continued
to import nearly the same amount of British
cotton goods and yarn (from £16,000,000 to
£25,700,000 in 1900-1908), she threw already
in 1887 on the foreign markets no less than
£3,635,510 worth of her own cottons of Lancashire
patterns; she exported 33,000,000 yards of
<em>gray cotton piece goods</em> manufactured in India by
Indian workmen. And the export has continued
to grow since, so that in the year 1910-1911
the value of the piece-goods and yarn exported
from India reached the value of £7,943,700.</p>

<p>The jute factories in India have grown at a
still speedier rate, and the once flourishing jute
trade of Dundee was brought to decay, not only
by the high tariffs of continental powers, but also
by Indian competition.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Even woollen mills
have lately been started; while the iron industry
took a sudden development in India, since the
means were found, after many experiments and
failures, to work furnaces with local coal. In a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
few years, we are told by specialists, India will
be self-supporting for iron. Nay, it is not without
apprehension that the English manufacturers
see that the imports of Indian manufactured
textiles to this country are steadily growing,
while in the markets of the Far East and Africa
India becomes a serious competitor to the mother
country.</p>

<p>Why should it not be so? What <em>might</em> prevent
the growth of Indian manufactures? Is it the
want of capital? But capital knows no fatherland;
and if high profits can be derived from
the work of Indian coolies whose wages are only
one-half of those of English workmen, or even
less, capital will migrate to India, as it has gone
to Russia, although its migration may mean
starvation for Lancashire and Dundee. Is it the
want of knowledge? But longitudes and latitudes
are no obstacle to its spreading; it is
only the first steps that are difficult. As to the
superiority of workmanship, nobody who knows
the Hindoo worker will doubt about his capacities.
Surely they are not below those of the
36,000 children less than fourteen years of age,
or the 238,000 boys and girls less than eighteen
years old, who are employed in the British
textile manufactories.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Twenty years surely are not much in the life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
of nations. And yet within the last twenty
years another powerful competitor has grown
in the East. I mean Japan. In October, 1888,
the <cite>Textile Recorder</cite> mentioned in a few lines that
the annual production of yarns in the cotton
mills of Japan had attained 9,498,500 lb., and
that fifteen more mills, which would hold
156,100 spindles, were in course of erection.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Two years later, 27,000,000 lb. of yarn were spun
in Japan; and while in 1887-1888 Japan imported
five or six times as much yarn from abroad as
was spun at home, next year two-thirds only
of the total consumption of the country were
imported from abroad.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>From that date the production grew up regularly.
From 6,435,000 lb. in 1886 it reached
91,950,000 lb. in 1893, and 153,444,000 lb. in
1895. In nine years it had thus increased twenty-four
times. Since then it rose to 413,800,000 lb.
in 1909; and we learn from the <cite>Financial
Economical Annual</cite> for the years 1910 and
1911, published at Tokio, that there were in
Japan, in 1909, no less than 3,756 textile factories,
with 1,785,700 spindles and 51,185 power-looms,
to which 783,155 hand-looms must be
added. Japan is thus already a serious competitor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of the great industrial nations for tissues
altogether, and especially for cottons, in the
markets of Eastern Asia; and it took it only
five-and-twenty years to attain this position.
The total production of tissues, valued at
£1,200,000 in the year 1887, rapidly rose to
£14,270,000 in 1895 and to £22,500,000 in
1909&mdash;cottons entering into this amount to the
extent of nearly two-fifths. Consequently, the
imports of foreign cotton goods from Europe
fell from £1,640,000 in 1884 to £849,600 in 1895,
and to £411,600 in 1910, while the exports of
silk goods rose to nearly £3,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>As to the coal and iron industries, I ventured
in the first edition of this book to predict that
the Japanese would not long remain a tributary
to Europe for iron goods&mdash;that their ambition
was also to have their own shipbuilding yards,
and that the previous year 300 engineers left the
Elswick works of Mr. Armstrong in order to
start shipbuilding in Japan. They were engaged
for five years only&mdash;the Japanese expecting to
have learned enough in five years to be their own
shipbuilders. This prediction has been entirely
fulfilled. Japan has now 1,030 iron and machine
works, and she now builds her own warships.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
During the last war, the progress realised in all
industries connected with war was rendered
fully evident.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>All this shows that the much-dreaded invasion
of the East upon European markets is in rapid
progress. The Chinese slumber still; but I am
firmly persuaded from what I saw of China that
the moment they will begin to manufacture with
the aid of European machinery&mdash;and the first
steps have already been made&mdash;they will do it
with more success, and necessarily on a far
greater scale, than even the Japanese.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But what about the United States, which
cannot be accused of employing cheap labour
or of sending to Europe “cheap and nasty”
produce? Their great industry is of yesterday’s
date; and yet the States already send to old
Europe constantly increasing quantities of
machinery. In 1890 they began even to export
iron, which they obtain at a very low cost, owing
to admirable new methods which they have
introduced in metallurgy.</p>

<p>In the course of twenty years (1870-1890) the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
number of persons employed in the American
manufactures was more than doubled, and the
value of their produce was nearly trebled; and
in the course of the next fifteen years, the number
of persons employed increased again by nearly
fifty per cent., while the value of the produce was
nearly doubled.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The cotton industry, supplied
with excellent home-made machinery, has been
rapidly developing, so that the yearly production
of textiles attained in 1905 a value of
2,147,441,400 dollars, thus being twice as large
as the yearly production of the United Kingdom
in the same branch (which was valued at about
£200,000,000); and the exports of cottons of
domestic manufacture attained in 1910 the
respectable figure of £8,600,000.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> As to the
yearly output of pig-iron and steel, it is already
in excess of the yearly output in Britain;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the organisation of that industry is also superior,
as Mr. Berkley pointed out, already in 1891,
in his address to the Institute of Civil Engineers.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>But all this has grown almost entirely within
the last thirty or forty years&mdash;whole industries
having been created entirely since 1860.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> What
will, then, American industry be twenty years,
hence, aided as it is by a wonderful development
of technical skill, by excellent schools, a scientific
education which goes hand in hand with technical
education, and a spirit of enterprise which is
unrivalled in Europe?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Volumes have been written about the crisis of
1886-1887, a crisis which, to use the words of
the Parliamentary Commission, lasted since 1875,
with but “a short period of prosperity enjoyed
by certain branches of trade in the years 1880
to 1883,” and a crisis, I shall add, which extended
over all the chief manufacturing countries
of the world. All possible causes of the crisis
have been examined; but, whatever the cacophony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
of conclusions arrived at, all unanimously
agreed upon one, namely, that of the Parliamentary
Commission, which could be summed
up as follows: “The manufacturing countries
do not find such customers as would enable them
to realise high profits.” Profits being the basis
of capitalist industry, low profits explain all
ulterior consequences.</p>

<p>Low profits induce the employers to reduce the
wages, or the number of workers, or the number
of days of employment during the week, or eventually
compel them to resort to the manufacture
of lower kinds of goods, which, as a rule, are paid
worse than the higher sorts. As Adam Smith
said, low profits ultimately mean a reduction of
wages, and low wages mean a reduced consumption
by the worker. Low profits mean also a
somewhat reduced consumption by the employer;
and both together mean lower profits
and reduced consumption with that immense
class of middlemen which has grown up in
manufacturing countries, and that, again, means
a further reduction of profits for the employers.</p>

<p>A country which manufactures to a great
extent for export, and therefore lives to a considerable
amount on the profits derived from her
foreign trade, stands very much in the same
position as Switzerland, which lives to a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
extent on the profits derived from the foreigners
who visit her lakes and glaciers. A good “season”
means an influx of from £1,000,000 to
£2,000,000 of money imported by the tourists,
and a bad “season” has the effects of a bad
crop in an agricultural country: a general impoverishment
follows. So it is also with a
country which manufactures for export. If the
“season” is bad, and the exported goods cannot
be sold abroad for twice their value at home, the
country which lives chiefly on these bargains
suffers. Low profits for the innkeepers of the
Alps mean narrowed circumstances in large
parts of Switzerland; and low profits for the
Lancashire and Scotch manufacturers, and the
wholesale exporters, mean narrowed circumstances
in Great Britain. The cause is the same
in both cases.</p>

<p>For many decades past we had not seen such
a cheapness of wheat and manufactured goods
as we saw in 1883-1884, and yet in 1886 the
country was suffering from a terrible crisis.
People said, of course, that the cause of the crisis
was over-production. But over-production is a
word utterly devoid of sense if it does not mean
that those who are in need of all kinds of produce
have not the means for buying them with their
low wages. Nobody would dare to affirm that
there is too much furniture in the crippled cot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>tages,
too many bedsteads and bedclothes in the
workmen’s dwellings, too many lamps burning
in the huts, and too much cloth on the shoulders,
not only of those who used to sleep (in 1886) in
Trafalgar Square between two newspapers, but
even in those households where a silk hat makes
a part of the Sunday dress. And nobody will
dare to affirm that there is too much food in
the homes of those agricultural labourers who
earn twelve shillings a week, or of those women
who earn from fivepence to sixpence a day in the
clothing trade and other small industries which
swarm in the outskirts of all great cities. Over-production
means merely and simply a want of
purchasing powers amidst the workers. And
the same want of purchasing powers of the
workers was felt everywhere on the Continent
during the years 1885-1887.</p>

<p>After the bad years were over, a sudden
revival of international trade took place; and,
as the British exports rose in four years (1886 to
1890) by nearly 24 per cent., it began to be said
that there was no reason for being alarmed by
foreign competition; that the decline of exports
in 1885-1887 was only temporary, and general
in Europe; and that England, now as of old,
fully maintained her dominant position in the
international trade. It is certainly true that if
we consider exclusively the money value of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
exports for the years 1876 to 1895, we see no
permanent decline, we notice only fluctuations.
British exports, like commerce altogether, seem
to show a certain periodicity. They fell from
£201,000,000 sterling in 1876 to £192,000,000 in
1879; then they rose again to £241,000,000 in
1882, and fell down to £213,000,000 in 1886;
again they rose to £264,000,000 in 1890, but fell
again, reaching a minimum of £216,000,000 in
1894, to be followed next year by a slight movement
upwards.</p>

<p>This periodicity being a fact, Mr. Giffen could
make light in 1886 of “German competition”
by showing that exports from the United Kingdom
had not decreased. It can even be said
that, per head of population, they had remained
unchanged until 1904, undergoing only the usual
ups and downs.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> However, when we come to
consider the <em>quantities</em> exported, and compare
them with the <em>money values</em> of the exports, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Mr. Giffen had to acknowledge that the prices
of 1883 were so low in comparison with those
of 1873 that in order to reach the same money
value the United Kingdom would have had to
export four pieces of cotton instead of three,
and eight or ten tons of metallic goods instead
of six. “The aggregate of British foreign trade,
if valued at the prices of ten years previously,
would have amounted to £861,000,000 instead of
£667,000,000,” we were told by no less an
authority than the Commission on Trade Depression.</p>

<p>It might, however, be said that 1873 was an
exceptional year, owing to the inflated demand
which took place after the Franco-German war.
But the same downward movement continued for
a number of years. Thus, if we take the figures
given in the <cite>Statesman’s Year-book</cite>, we see that
while the United Kingdom exported, in 1883,
4,957,000,000 yards of piece goods (cotton,
woollen and linen) and 316,000,000 lb. of yarn in
order to reach an export value of £104,000,000,
the same country had to export, in 1895, no less
than 5,478,000,000 yards of the same stuffs and
330,000,000 lb. of yarn in order to realise
£99,700,000 only. And the figures would have
appeared still more unfavourable if we took
the cottons alone. True, the conditions improved
during the last ten years, so that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
1906 the exports were similar to those of 1873;
and they were better still in 1911, which was a
year of an extraordinary foreign trade, when
7,041,000,000 yards of stuffs and 307,000,000 lb.
of yarn were exported&mdash;the two being valued at
£163,400,000. However, it was especially the
yarn which kept the high prices, because it is
the finest sorts of yarn which are now exported.
But the great profits of the years 1873-1880
are irretrievably gone.</p>

<p>We thus see that while the total value of the
exports from the United Kingdom, in proportion
to its growing population, remains, broadly
speaking, unaltered for the last thirty years, the
high prices which could be got for the exports
thirty years ago, and with them the high profits,
are gone. And no amount of arithmetical calculations
will persuade the British manufacturers
that such is not the case. They know perfectly
well that the home markets grow continually
overstocked; that the best foreign markets are
escaping; and that in the neutral markets
Britain is being undersold. This is the unavoidable
consequence of the development of
manufactures all over the world. (See <a href="#APP_J">Appendix J</a>.)</p>

<p>Great hopes were laid, some time ago, in Australia
as a market for British goods; but
Australia will soon do what Canada already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
does. She will manufacture. And the colonial
exhibitions, by showing to the “colonists” what
they are able to do, and how they must do, are
only accelerating the day when each colony <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">farà
da sè</i> in her turn. Canada and India already
impose protective duties on British goods. As
to the much-spoken-of markets on the Congo,
and Mr. Stanley’s calculations and promises of a
trade amounting to £26,000,000 a year if the
Lancashire people supply the Africans with loin-cloths,
such promises belong to the same category
of fancies as the famous nightcaps of the
Chinese which were to enrich England after the
first Chinese war. The Chinese prefer their own
home-made nightcaps; and as to the Congo
people, four countries at least are already competing
for supplying them with their poor dress:
Britain, Germany, the United States, and, last
but not least, India.</p>

<p>There was a time when this country had almost
the monopoly in the cotton industries; but
already in 1880 she possessed only 55 per cent. of
all the spindles at work in Europe, the United
States and India (40,000,000 out of 72,000,000),
and a little more than one-half of the looms
(550,000 out of 972,000). In 1893 the proportion
was further reduced to 49 per cent. of the spindles
(45,300,000 out of 91,340,000), and now the
United Kingdom has only 41 per cent. of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the spindles.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It was thus losing ground while
the others were winning. And the fact is quite
natural: it might have been foreseen. There is
no reason why Britain should always be the great
cotton manufactory of the world, when raw
cotton has to be imported into this country as
elsewhere. It was quite natural that France,
Germany, Italy, Russia, India, Japan, the
United States, and even Mexico and Brazil,
should begin to spin their own yarns and to
weave their own cotton stuffs. But the appearance
of the cotton industry in a country, or, in
fact, of any textile industry, unavoidably becomes
the starting-point for the growth of a series of
other industries; chemical and mechanical
works, metallurgy and mining feel at once the
impetus given by a new want. The whole of the
home industries, as also technical education
altogether, <em>must</em> improve in order to satisfy
that want as soon as it has been felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p>What has happened with regard to cottons is
going on also with regard to other industries.
Great Britain, which stood in 1880 at the head
of the list of countries producing pig-iron, came
in 1904 the third in the same list, which was
headed by the United States and Germany;
while Russia, which occupied the seventh place
in 1880, comes now fourth, after Great Britain.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Britain and Belgium have no longer the monopoly
of the woollen trade. Immense factories at
Verviers are silent; the Belgian weavers are
misery-stricken, while Germany yearly increases
her production of woollens, and exports nine
times more woollens than Belgium. Austria has
her own woollens and exports them; Riga,
Lodz, and Moscow supply Russia with fine woollen
cloths; and the growth of the woollen industry
in each of the last-named countries calls
into existence hundreds of connected trades.</p>

<p>For many years France has had the monopoly
of the silk trade. Silkworms being reared in
Southern France, it was quite natural that
Lyons should grow into a centre for the manufacture
of silks. Spinning, domestic weaving,
and dyeing works developed to a great extent.
But eventually the industry took such an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
extension that home supplies of raw silk became
insufficient, and raw silk was imported from
Italy, Spain and Southern Austria, Asia Minor,
the Caucasus and Japan, to the amount of from
£9,000,000 to £11,000,000 in 1875 and 1876,
while France had only £800,000 worth of her own
silk. Thousands of peasant boys and girls were
attracted by high wages to Lyons and the neighbouring
district; the industry was prosperous.</p>

<p>However, by-and-by new centres of silk trade
grew up at Basel and in the peasant houses
round Zürich. French emigrants imported the
trade into Switzerland, and it developed there,
especially after the civil war of 1871. Then the
Caucasus Administration invited French workmen
and women from Lyons and Marseilles to
teach the Georgians and the Russians the best
means of rearing the silkworm, as well as the
whole of the silk trade; and Stavropol became
a new centre for silk weaving. Austria and the
United States did the same; and what are now
the results?</p>

<p>During the years 1872 to 1881 Switzerland
more than doubled the produce of her silk industry;
Italy and Germany increased it by one-third;
and the Lyons region, which formerly
manufactured to the value of 454 million francs
a year, showed in 1887 a return of only 378
millions. The exports of Lyons silks, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
reached an average of 425,000,000 francs in
1855-1859, and 460,000,000 in 1870-1874, fell
down to 233,000,000 in 1887. And it is reckoned
by French specialists that at present no less than
one-third of the silk stuffs used in France are
imported from Zurich, Crefeld, and Barmen.
Nay, even Italy, which has now 191,000 persons
engaged in the industry, sends her silks to
France and competes with Lyons.</p>

<p>The French manufacturers may cry as loudly
as they like for protection, or resort to the production
of cheaper goods of lower quality;
they may sell 3,250,000 kilogrammes of silk
stuffs at the same price as they sold 2,500,000 in
1855-1859&mdash;they will never again regain the
position they occupied before. Italy, Switzerland,
Germany, the United States and Russia
have their own silk factories, and will import
from Lyons only the highest qualities of stuffs.
As to the lower sorts, a foulard has become a
common attire with the St. Petersburg housemaids,
because the North Caucasian domestic
trades supply them at a price which would starve
the Lyons weavers. The trade has been decentralised,
and while Lyons is still a centre for the
higher artistic silks, it will never be again the
chief centre for the silk trade which it was thirty
years ago.</p>

<p>Like examples could be produced by the score.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Greenock no longer supplies Russia with sugar,
because Russia has plenty of her own at the
same price as it sells at in England. The watch
trade is no more a speciality of Switzerland:
watches are now made everywhere. India
extracts from her ninety collieries two-thirds
of her annual consumption of coal. The chemical
trade which grew up on the banks of the
Clyde and Tyne, owing to the special advantages
offered for the import of Spanish pyrites and the
agglomeration of such a variety of industries
along the two estuaries, is now in decay. Spain,
with the help of English capital, is beginning to
utilise her own pyrites for herself; and Germany
has become a great centre for the manufacture
of sulphuric acid and soda&mdash;nay, she already
complains about over-production.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But enough! I have before me so many
figures, all telling the same tale, that examples
could be multiplied at will. It is time to conclude,
and, for every unprejudiced mind, the
conclusion is self-evident. Industries of all
kinds decentralise and are scattered all over the
globe; and everywhere a variety, an integrated
variety, of trades grows, instead of specialisation.
Such are the prominent features of the times we
live in. Each nation becomes in its turn a
manufacturing nation; and the time is not far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
off when each nation of Europe, as well as the
United States, and even the most backward
nations of Asia and America, will themselves
manufacture nearly everything they are in need
of. Wars and several accidental causes may
check for some time the scattering of industries:
they will not stop it; it is unavoidable. For
each new-comer the first steps only are difficult.
But, as soon as any industry has taken firm root,
it calls into existence hundreds of other trades;
and as soon as the first steps have been made,
and the first obstacles have been overcome, the
industrial growth goes on at an accelerated rate.</p>

<p>The fact is so well felt, if not understood, that
the race for colonies has become the distinctive
feature of the last twenty years. Each nation
will have her own colonies. But colonies will not
help. There is not a second India in the world,
and the old conditions will be repeated no more.
Nay, some of the British colonies already threaten
to become serious competitors with their mother
country; others, like Australia, will not fail
to follow the same lines. As to the yet neutral
markets, China will never be a serious customer
to Europe: she can produce much cheaper at
home; and when she begins to feel a need for
goods of European patterns, she will produce them
herself. Woe to Europe, if on the day that the
steam engine invades China she is still relying on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
foreign customers! As to the African half-savages,
their misery is no foundation for the
well-being of a civilised nation.</p>

<p>Progress must be looked for in another
direction. <em>It is in producing for home use.</em> The
customers for the Lancashire cottons and the
Sheffield cutlery, the Lyons silks and the Hungarian
flour-mills, are not in India, nor in Africa.
The true consumers of the produce of our
factories must be our own populations. And
they <em>can</em> be that, once we organise our economical
life so that they might issue from their present
destitution. No use to send floating shops to
New Guinea with British or German millinery,
when there are plenty of would-be customers
for British millinery in these very islands, and
for German goods in Germany. Instead of
worrying our brains by schemes for getting
customers abroad, it would be better to
try to answer the following questions: Why
the British worker, whose industrial capacities
are so highly praised in political speeches;
why the Scotch crofter and the Irish peasant,
whose obstinate labours in creating new productive
soil out of peat bogs are occasionally so much
spoken of, are no customers to the Lancashire
weavers, the Sheffield cutlers and the Northumbrian
and Welsh pitmen? Why the Lyons
weavers not only do not wear silks, but sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
have no food in their attics? Why the Russian
peasants sell their corn, and for four, six, and
sometimes eight months every year are compelled
to mix bark and auroch grass to a handful
of flour for baking their bread? Why famines
are so common amidst the growers of wheat and
rice in India?</p>

<p>Under the present conditions of division into
capitalists and labourers, into property-holders
and masses living on uncertain wages, the spreading
of industries over new fields is accompanied
by the very same horrible facts of pitiless
oppression, massacre of children, pauperism, and
insecurity of life. The Russian Fabrics Inspectors’
Reports, the Reports of the Plauen Handelskammer,
the Italian inquests, and the reports
about the growing industries of India and Japan
are full of the same revelations as the Reports
of the Parliamentary Commissions of 1840 to
1842, or the modern revelations with regard
to the “sweating system” at Whitechapel and
Glasgow, London pauperism, and York unemployment.
The Capital and Labour problem
is thus universalised; but, at the same
time, it is also simplified. To return to a state
of affairs where corn is grown, and manufactured
goods are fabricated, <em>for the use of those very people
who grow and produce them</em>&mdash;such will be,
no doubt, the problem to be solved during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
next coming years of European history. Each
region will become its own producer and its
own consumer of manufactured goods. But
that unavoidably implies that, at the same time,
it will be its own producer and consumer of
agricultural produce; and that is precisely what
I am going to discuss next.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capy">The industrial and commercial history of
the world during the last fifty years has
been a history of decentralisation of industry.
It was not a mere shifting of the centre of
gravity of commerce, such as Europe witnessed
in the past, when the commercial hegemony
migrated from Italy to Spain, to Holland, and
finally to Britain: it had a much deeper meaning,
as it excluded the very possibility of commercial
or industrial hegemony. It has shown the
growth of quite new conditions, and new conditions
require new adaptations. To endeavour
to revive the past would be useless: a new departure
must be taken by civilised nations.</p>

<p>Of course, there will be plenty of voices to argue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
that the former supremacy of the pioneers must
be maintained at any price: all pioneers are in
the habit of saying so. It will be suggested
that the pioneers must attain such a superiority
of technical knowledge and organisation as to
enable them to beat all their younger competitors;
that force must be resorted to if
necessary. But force is reciprocal; and if the
god of war always sides with the strongest battalions,
those battalions are strongest which fight
for new rights against outgrown privileges. As
to the honest longing for more technical education&mdash;surely
let us all have as much of it as
possible: it will be a boon for humanity; for
humanity, of course&mdash;not for a single nation,
because knowledge cannot be cultivated for home
use only. Knowledge and invention, boldness
of thought and enterprise, conquests of genius
and improvements of social organisation have
become international growths; and no kind of
progress&mdash;intellectual, industrial or social&mdash;can
be kept within political boundaries; it crosses
the seas, it pierces the mountains; steppes are
no obstacle to it. Knowledge and inventive
powers are now so thoroughly international
that if a simple newspaper paragraph announces
to-morrow that the problem of storing force, of
printing without inking, or of aerial navigation,
has received a practical solution in one country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
of the world, we may feel sure that within a few
weeks the same problem will be solved, almost in
the same way, by several inventors of different
nationalities.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Continually we learn that the
same scientific discovery, or technical invention,
has been made within a few days’ distance, in
countries a thousand miles apart; as if there
were a kind of atmosphere which favours the
germination of a given idea at a given moment.
And such an atmosphere exists: steam, print
and the common stock of knowledge have
created it.</p>

<p>Those who dream of monopolising technical
genius are therefore fifty years behind the
times. The world&mdash;the wide, wide world&mdash;is
now the true domain of knowledge; and if each
nation displays some special capacities in some
special branch, the various capacities of different
nations compensate one another, and the advantages
which could be derived from them
would be only temporary. The fine British
workmanship in mechanical arts, the American
boldness for gigantic enterprise, the French
systematic mind, and the German pedagogy, are
becoming international capacities. Sir William
Armstrong, in his works established in Italy
and Japan, has already communicated to Italians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
and Japanese those capacities for managing huge
iron masses which have been nurtured on the
Tyne; the uproarious American spirit of enterprise
pervades the Old World; the French taste
for harmony becomes European taste; and
German pedagogy&mdash;improved, I dare say&mdash;is
at home in Russia. So, instead of trying to keep
life in the old channels, it would be better to see
what the new conditions are, what duties they
impose on our generation.</p>

<p>The characters of the new conditions are plain,
and their consequences are easy to understand.
As the manufacturing nations of West Europe
are meeting with steadily growing difficulties
in selling their manufactured goods abroad, and
getting food in exchange, they will be compelled
to grow their food at home; they will be bound
to rely on home customers for their manufactures,
and on home producers for their food.
And the sooner they do so the better.</p>

<p>Two great objections stand, however, in the
way against the general acceptance of such
conclusions. We have been taught, both by
economists and politicians, that the territories
of the West European States are so overcrowded
with inhabitants that they cannot grow all the
food and raw produce which are necessary for
the maintenance of their steadily increasing
populations. Therefore the necessity of ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>porting
manufactured goods and of importing
food. And we are told, moreover, that even
if it were possible to grow in Western Europe
all the food necessary for its inhabitants, there
would be no advantage in doing so as long as the
same food can be got cheaper from abroad.
Such are the present teachings and the ideas
which are current in society at large. And yet
it is easy to prove that both are totally erroneous:
plenty of food could be grown on the territories
of Western Europe for much more than their
present populations, and an immense benefit
would be derived from doing so. These are the
two points which I have now to discuss.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To begin by taking the most disadvantageous
case: is it possible that the soil of Great Britain,
which at present yields food for one-third only
of its inhabitants, could provide all the necessary
amount and variety of food for 41,000,000
human beings when it covers only 56,000,000
acres all told&mdash;forests and rocks, marshes and
peat-bogs, cities, railways and fields&mdash;out of
which only 33,000,000 acres are considered as
cultivable?<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The current opinion is, that it by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
no means can; and that opinion is so inveterate
that we even see men of science, who are generally
cautious when dealing with current opinions,
endorse that opinion without even taking the
trouble of verifying it. It is accepted as an
axiom. And yet, as soon as we try to find out any
argument in its favour, we discover that it has
not the slightest foundation, either in facts or
in judgment based upon well-known facts.</p>

<p>Let us take, for instance, J. B. Lawes’ estimates
of crops which were published every year
in <cite>The Times</cite>. In his estimate of the year 1887
he made the remark that during the eight
harvest years 1853-1860 “nearly three-fourths
of the aggregate amount of wheat consumed in
the United Kingdom was of home growth, and
little more than one-fourth was derived from
foreign sources”; but five-and-twenty years
later the figures were almost reversed&mdash;that is,
“during the eight years 1879-1886, little
more than one-third has been provided by home
crops and nearly two-thirds by imports.” But
neither the increase of population by 8,000,000
nor the increase of consumption of wheat by
six-tenths of a bushel per head could account
for the change. In the years 1853-1860 the soil
of Britain nourished one inhabitant on every
two acres cultivated: why did it require three
acres in order to nourish the same inhabitant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
in 1887? The answer is plain: merely and
simply because agriculture had fallen into
neglect.</p>

<p>In fact, the area under wheat had been
reduced since 1853-1860 by full 1,590,000 acres,
and therefore the average crop of the years
1883-1886 was below the average crop of
1853-1860 by more than 40,000,000 bushels;
and this deficit alone represented the food of
more than 7,000,000 inhabitants. At the same
time the area under barley, oats, beans, and
other spring crops had also been reduced by a
further 560,000 acres, which, alone, at the low
average of thirty bushels per acre, would have
represented the cereals necessary to complete
the above, for the same 7,000,000 inhabitants.
It can thus be said that if the United Kingdom
imported cereals for 17,000,000 inhabitants in
1887, instead of for 10,000,000 in 1860, it was
simply because more than 2,000,000 acres had
gone out of cultivation.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>These facts are well known; but usually they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
are met with the remark that the character
of agriculture had been altered: that instead of
growing wheat, meat and milk were produced in
this country. However, the figures for 1887,
compared with the figures for 1860, show that
the same downward movement took place
under the heads of green crops and the like. The
area under potatoes was reduced by 280,000
acres; under turnips by 180,000 acres; and
although there was an increase under the heads
of mangold, carrots, etc., still the aggregate
area under all these crops was reduced by a
further 330,000 acres. An increase of area
was found only for permanent pasture (2,800,000
acres) and grass under rotation (1,600,000
acres); but we should look in vain for a corresponding
increase of live stock. The increase
of live stock which took place during those
twenty-seven years was not sufficient to cover
even the area reclaimed from waste land.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Since the year 1887 affairs went, however,
from worse to worse. If we take Great Britain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
alone, we see that in 1885 the area under all
corn crops was 8,392,006 acres; that is very
small, indeed, in comparison to the area which
could have been cultivated; but even that
little was further reduced to 7,400,227 acres in
1895. The area under wheat was 2,478,318
acres in 1885 (as against 3,630,300 in 1874); but
it dwindled away to 1,417,641 acres in 1895,
while the area under the other cereals increased
by a trifle only&mdash;from 5,198,026 acres to
5,462,184&mdash;the total loss on all cereals being
nearly 1,000,000 <em>acres in ten years</em>! Another
5,000,000 people were thus compelled to get
their food from abroad.</p>

<p>Did the area under green crops increase correspondingly,
as it would have done if it were
only the character of agriculture that had
changed? Not in the least! This area was
further reduced by nearly 500,000 acres
(3,521,602 in 1885, 3,225,762 in 1895, and
3,006,000 in 1909-1911). Or was the area under
clover and grasses in rotation increased in
proportion to all these reductions? Alas no!
It also was reduced (4,654,173 acres in 1885,
4,729,801 in 1895, and 4,164,000 acres in 1909-1911).
In short, taking all the land that is
under crops in rotation (17,201,490 acres in
1885, 16,166,950 acres in 1895, 14,795,570 only
in 1905, and 14,682,550 in 1909-1911), we see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
that within the last twenty-six years another
2,500,000 acres went out of cultivation, without
any compensation whatever. It went to increase
that already enormous area of more than
17,000,000 acres (17,460,000 in 1909-1911)&mdash;<em>more
than one-half of the cultivable area</em>&mdash;which
goes under the head of “permanent pasture,”
and hardly suffices to feed one cow on each
three acres!</p>

<p>Need I say, after that, that quite to the
contrary of what we are told about the British
agriculturists becoming “meat-makers” instead
of “wheat-growers,” no corresponding increase
of live stock took place during the last twenty-five
years. Far from devoting the land freed
from cereals to “meat-making,” the country
further reduced its live stock in 1885-1895,
and began to show a slight increase during
the last few years only. It had 6,597,964
head of horned cattle in 1885, 6,354,336 in
1895, and 7,057,520 in 1909-1911; 26,534,600
sheep in 1885, 25,792,200 in 1895, and from
26,500,000 to 27,610,000 in 1909-1911. True,
the number of horses increased; every butcher
and greengrocer runs now a horse “to take
orders at the gents’ doors” (in Sweden
and Switzerland, by the way, they do it by
telephone). But if we take the numbers of
horses used in agriculture, unbroken, and kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
for breeding, we find only small oscillations
between 1,408,790 in 1885 and 1,553,000 in
1909. But numbers of horses are imported, as
also the oats and a considerable amount of the hay
that is required for feeding them.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> And if the
consumption of meat has really increased in this
country, it is due to cheap imported meat, not
to the meat that would be produced in these
islands.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>In short, agriculture has not changed its direction,
as we are often told; it simply went
down in all directions. Land is going out of culture
at a perilous rate, while the latest improvements
in market-gardening, fruit-growing and
poultry-keeping are but a mere trifle if we compare
them with what has been done in the same
direction in France, Belgium and America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<p>It must be said that during the last few years
there was a slight improvement. The area under
all corn crops was slightly increasing, and it
fluctuated about 7,000,000 acres, the increase
being especially notable for wheat (1,906,000
acres in 1911 as against 1,625,450 in 1907),
while the areas under barley and oats were
slightly diminished. But with all that, the
surface under corn crops is still nearly <em>one-and-a-half
million acres</em> below what it was in 1885,
and nearly <em>two-and-a-half million acres</em> below
1874. This represents, let us remember it, the
bread-food of <em>ten million people</em>.</p>

<p>The cause of this general downward movement
is self-evident. It is the desertion, the abandonment
of the land. Each crop requiring human
labour has had its area reduced; and almost
one-half of the agricultural labourers have been
sent away since 1861 to reinforce the ranks of the
unemployed in the cities,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> so that far from
being over-populated, the fields of Britain are
<em>starved of human labour</em>, as James Caird used to
say. The British nation does not work on her
soil; <em>she is prevented from doing so</em>; and the
would-be economists complain that the soil
will not nourish its inhabitants!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p>I once took a knapsack and went on foot out
of London, through Sussex. I had read Léonce
de Lavergne’s work and expected to find a soil
busily cultivated; but neither round London
nor still less further south did I see men in the
fields. In the Weald I could walk for twenty
miles without crossing anything but heath or
woodlands, rented as pheasant-shooting grounds
to “London gentlemen,” as the labourers said.
“Ungrateful soil” was my first thought; but
then I would occasionally come to a farm at the
crossing of two roads and see the same soil
bearing a rich crop; and my next thought was
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tel seigneur, telle terre</i>, as the French peasants
say. Later on I saw the rich fields of the midland
counties; but even there I was struck by not
perceiving the same busy human labour which
I was accustomed to admire on the Belgian
and French fields. But I ceased to wonder when
I learnt that only 1,383,000 men and women
in England and Wales work in the fields, while
more than 16,000,000 belong to the “professional,
domestic, indefinite, and unproductive class,”
as these pitiless statisticians say. One million
human beings cannot productively cultivate
an area of 33,000,000 acres, unless they can
resort to the Bonanza farm’s methods of culture.</p>

<p>Again, taking Harrow as the centre of my
excursions, I could walk five miles towards Lon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>don,
or turning my back upon it, and I could see
nothing east or west but meadow land on which
they hardly cropped two tons of hay per acre&mdash;scarcely
enough to keep alive one milch cow
on each two acres. Man is conspicuous by his
absence from those meadows; he rolls them
with a heavy roller in the spring; he spreads
some manure every two or three years; then
he disappears until the time has come to make
hay. And that&mdash;within ten miles from Charing
Cross, close to a city with 5,000,000 inhabitants,
supplied with Flemish and Jersey potatoes,
French salads and Canadian apples. In the
hands of the Paris gardeners, each thousand
acres situated within the same distance from the
city would be cultivated by at least 2,000 human
beings, who would get vegetables to the value of
from £50 to £300 per acre. But here the acres
which only need human hands to become an
inexhaustible source of golden crops lie idle, and
they say to us, “Heavy clay!” without even
knowing that in the hands of man there are no
unfertile soils; that the most fertile soils are
not in the prairies of America, nor in the Russian
steppes; that they are in the peat-bogs of Ireland,
on the sand downs of the northern sea-coast
of France, on the craggy mountains of the
Rhine, where they have been made by man’s
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span></p>

<p>The most striking fact is, however, that in
some undoubtedly fertile parts of the country
things are even in a worse condition. My heart
simply ached when I saw the state in which
land is kept in South Devon, and when I learned
to know what “permanent pasture” means.
Field after field is covered with nothing but
grass, three inches high, and thistles in profusion.
Twenty, thirty such fields can be seen at one
glance from the top of every hill; and thousands
of acres are in that state, notwithstanding that
the grandfathers of the present generation have
devoted a formidable amount of labour to the
clearing of that land from the stones, to fencing
it, roughly draining it and the like. In every
direction I could see abandoned cottages and
orchards going to ruin. A whole population has
disappeared, and even its last vestiges must
disappear if things continue to go on as they
have gone. And this takes place in a part
of the country endowed with a most fertile
soil and possessed of a climate which is
certainly more congenial than the climate of
Jersey in spring and early summer&mdash;a land
upon which even the poorest cottagers occasionally
raise potatoes as early as the first
half of May. But how can that land be cultivated
when there is nobody to cultivate it?
“We have fields; men go by, but never go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
in,” an old labourer said to me; and so it is
in reality.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Such were my impressions of British agriculture
twenty years ago. Unfortunately, both the
official statistical data and the mass of private
evidence published since tend to show that but
little improvement took place in the general
conditions of agriculture in this country within
the last twenty years. Some successful attempts
in various new directions have been made in
different parts of the country, and I will have the
pleasure to mention them further on, the more
so as they show what a quite average soil in these
islands can give when it is properly treated.
But over large areas, especially in the southern
counties, the general conditions are even worse
than they were twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Altogether one cannot read the mass of review
and newspaper articles, and books dealing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
British agriculture that have been published
lately, without realising that the agricultural
depression which began in the “seventies” and
the “eighties” of the nineteenth century had
causes much more deeply seated than the fall
in the prices of wheat in consequence of American
competition. However, it would lie beyond the
scope of this book to enter here into such a discussion.
Moreover, anyone who will read a few
review articles written from the points of view
of different parties, or consult such books as
that of Mr. Christopher Turnor,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> or study the
elaborate inquest made by Rider Haggard in
twenty-six counties of England&mdash;paying more
attention to the <em>data</em> accumulated in this book
than to the sometimes biassed conclusions of the
author&mdash;will soon see himself what are the causes
which hamper the development of British agriculture.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In Scotland the conditions are equally bad.
The population described as “rural” is in a
steady decrease: in 1911 it was already less
than 800,000; and as regards the agricultural
labourers, their number has decreased by 42,370
(from 135,970 to 93,600) in the twenty years,
1881 to 1901. <em>The land goes out of culture</em>,
while the area under “deer forests”&mdash;that is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
under hunting grounds established upon what
formerly was <em>arable</em> land for the amusement of
the rich&mdash;increases at an appalling rate. No
need to say that at the same time the Scotch
population is emigrating, and Scotland is depopulated
at an appalling speed.</p>

<p>My chief purpose being to show here what <em>can
and ought to be</em> obtained from the land under a
proper and intelligent treatment, I shall only
indicate one of the disadvantages of the systems
of husbandry in vogue in this country. Both
landlords and farmers gradually came of late
to pursue other aims than that of obtaining
from the land the greatest amount of produce
than can be obtained; and when this problem
of a maximum productivity of the land arose
before the European nations, and therefore a
complete modification of the methods of husbandry
was rendered imperative, such a modification
was <em>not</em> accomplished in this country.
While in France, Belgium, Germany and Denmark
the agriculturists did their best to meet
the effects of American competition by rendering
their culture more intensive in all directions,
in this country the already antiquated method
of reducing the area under corn crops and laying
land for grass continues to prevail, although
it ought to be evident that mere <em>grazing</em> will
pay no more, and that some effort in the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
direction would increase the returns of the corn
crops, as also those of the roots and plants
cultivated for industrial purposes. The land
continues to go out of culture, while the
problem of the day is to render culture more
and more intensive.</p>

<p>Many causes have combined to produce that
undesirable result. The concentration of land-ownership
in the hands of big landowners; the
high profits obtained previously; the development
of a class of both landlords and farmers
who rely chiefly upon other incomes than those
they draw from the land, and for whom farming
has thus become a sort of pleasant by-occupation
or sport; the rapid development of game reserves
for sportsmen, both British and foreign; the
absence of men of initiative who would have
shown to the nation the necessity of a new
departure; the absence of a desire to win the
necessary knowledge, and the absence of institutions
which could widely spread practical
agricultural knowledge and introduce improved
seeds and seedlings, as the Experimental Farms
of the United States and Canada are doing;
the dislike of that spirit of agricultural co-operation
to which the Danish farmers owe their
successes, and so on&mdash;all these stand in the way
of the unavoidable change in the methods of
farming, and produce the results of which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
British writers on agriculture are complaining.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
But it is self-evident that in order to compete
with countries where machinery is largely used
and new methods of farming are resorted to
(including the industrial treatment of farm
produce in sugar works, starch works, and the
drying of vegetables, etc., connected with farming),
the old methods cannot do; especially
when the farmer has to pay a rent of twenty,
forty, and occasionally fifty shillings per acre
for wheat-lands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It may be said, of course, that this opinion
strangely contrasts with the well-known superiority
of British agriculture. Do we not know,
indeed, that British crops average twenty-eight
to thirty bushels of wheat per acre, while in
France they reach only from seventeen to twenty
bushels? Does it not stand in all almanacs
that Britain gets every year £200,000,000
sterling worth of animal produce&mdash;milk, cheese,
meat and wool&mdash;from her fields? All that is
true, and there is no doubt that in many respects
British agriculture is superior to that of many
other nations. As regards obtaining the greatest
amount of produce with the least amount of
labour, Britain undoubtedly took the lead until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
she was superseded by America in the Bonanza
farms (now disappeared or rapidly disappearing).
Again, as regards the fine breeds of cattle, the
splendid state of the meadows and the results
obtained in separate farms, there is much to be
learned from Britain. But a closer acquaintance
with British agriculture as a whole discloses
many features of inferiority.</p>

<p>However splendid, a meadow remains a
meadow, much inferior in productivity to a corn-field;
and the fine breeds of cattle appear to be
poor creatures as long as each ox requires three
acres of land to be fed upon. As regards the
crops, certainly one may indulge in some admiration
at the average twenty-eight or thirty bushels
grown in this country; but when we learn that
only 1,600,000 to 1,900,000 acres out of the
cultivable 33,000,000 bear such crops, we are
quite disappointed. Anyone could obtain like
results if he were to put all his manure into one-twentieth
part of the area which he possesses.
Again, the twenty-eight to thirty bushels no
longer appear to us so satisfactory when we learn
that without any manuring, merely by means of
a good culture, they have obtained at Rothamstead
an average of 14 bushels per acre from the
same plot of land for forty consecutive years;<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
while Mr. Prout, in his farm near Sawbridgeworth
(Herts), on a cold heavy clay, has obtained
since 1861 crops of from thirty to thirty-eight
bushels of wheat, year after year, without any
farm manure at all, by good steam ploughing
and artificial manure only. (R. Haggard, I. 528.)
Under the allotment system the crops reach
forty bushels. In some farms they occasionally
attain even fifty and fifty-seven bushels per acre.</p>

</div>

<p>If we intend to have a correct appreciation
of British agriculture, we must not base it upon
what is obtained on a few selected and well-manured
plots; we must inquire what is done
with the territory, taken as a whole.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
out of each 1,000 acres of the aggregate territory
of England, Wales and Scotland, 435 acres are
left under wood, coppice, heath, buildings, and
so on. We need not find fault with that division,
because it depends very much upon natural
causes. In France and Belgium one-third of the
territory is in like manner also treated as uncultivable,
although portions of it are continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
reclaimed and brought under culture. But,
leaving aside the “uncultivable” portion, let us
see what is done with the 565 acres out of 1,000
of the “cultivable” part (32,145,930 acres in
Great Britain in 1910). First of all, it is divided
into two parts, and one of them, the largest&mdash;308
acres out of 1,000&mdash;is left under “permanent
pasture,” that is, in most cases it is entirely
uncultivated. Very little hay is obtained from
it,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and some cattle are grazed upon it. More
than one-half of the cultivable area is thus left
without cultivation, and only 257 acres out of
each 1,000 acres are under culture. Out of these
last, 124 acres are under corn crops, twenty-one
acres under potatoes, fifty-three acres under
green crops, and seventy-three acres under clover
fields and grasses under rotation. And finally,
out of the 124 acres given to corn crops, the best
thirty-three, and some years only twenty-five
acres (one-fortieth part of the territory, one-twenty-third
of the cultivable area), are picked
out and sown with wheat. They are well cultivated,
well manured, and upon them an average
of from twenty-eight to thirty bushels to the
acre is obtained; and upon these twenty-five
or thirty acres out of 1,000 the world superiority
of British agriculture is based.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span></p>

<p>The net result of all that is, that on nearly
33,000,000 acres of cultivable land the food is
grown for one-third part only of the population
(more than two-thirds of the food it consumes is
imported), and we may say accordingly that,
although nearly two-thirds of the territory is
cultivable, British agriculture provides home-grown
food for each 125 or 135 inhabitants only
per square mile (out of 466). In other words,
nearly three acres of the <em>cultivable area</em> are required
to grow the food for each person. Let
us then see what is done with the land in France
and Belgium.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, if we simply compare the average thirty
bushels per acre of wheat in Great Britain with
the average nineteen to twenty bushels grown in
France within the last ten years, the comparison
is all in favour of these islands; but such averages
are of little value because the two systems
of agriculture are totally different in the two
countries. The Frenchman also has his picked
and heavily manured “twenty-five to thirty
acres” in the north of France and in Ile-de-France,
and from these picked acres he obtains
average crops ranging from thirty to thirty-three
bushels.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> However, he sows with wheat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
not only the best picked out acres, but also such
fields on the Central Plateau and in Southern
France as hardly yield ten, eight and even six
bushels to the acre, without irrigation; and
these low crops reduce the average for the whole
country.</p>

<p>The Frenchman cultivates much that is left
here under permanent pasture&mdash;and this is what
is described as his “inferiority” in agriculture.
In fact, although the proportion between what
we have named the “cultivable area” and the
total territory is very much the same in France
as it is in Great Britain (624 acres out of each
1,000 acres of the territory), the area under wheat
crops is nearly <em>six times</em> as great, in proportion,
as what it is in Great Britain (182 acres instead
of twenty-five or thirty, out of each 1,000 acres):
the corn crops altogether cover nearly two-fifths
of the cultivable area (375 acres out of 1000),
and large areas are given besides to green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
crops, industrial crops, vine, fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>Taking everything into consideration, although
the Frenchman keeps less cattle, and especially
grazes less sheep than the Briton, he nevertheless
obtains from his soil nearly all the food that he
and his cattle consume. He imports, in an average
year, but one-tenth only of what the nation
consumes, and he exports to this country considerable
quantities of food produce (£10,000,000
worth), not only from the south, but also, and
especially, from the shores of the Channel (Brittany
butter and vegetables; fruit and vegetables
from the suburbs of Paris, and so on).<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The net result is that, although one-third part
of the territory is also treated as “uncultivable,”
the soil of France yields the food for 170 inhabitants
per square mile (out of 188), that is, for
forty persons more, per square mile, than this
country.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<p>It is thus apparent that the comparison with
France is not so much in favour of this country
as it is said to be; and it will be still less favourable
when we come, in our next chapter, to
horticulture.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The comparison with Belgium is even more
striking&mdash;the more so as the two systems of
culture are similar in both countries. To begin
with, in Belgium we also find an average crop of
over thirty bushels of wheat to the acre; but the
area given to wheat is five times as big as in Great
Britain, in comparison to the cultivable area,
and the cereals cover two-fifths of the land avail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>able
for culture.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The land is so well cultivated
that the average crops for the years 1890-1899
(the very bad year of 1891 being left out of account)
were from twenty-six and a half to twenty-eight
and a half bushels per acre for winter wheat,
and reached an average of thirty-three and a half
bushels in 1900-1904; over fifty-four bushels for
oats (thirty-five to forty-one and a half in Great
Britain), and from forty to forty-three and a half
bushels for winter barley (twenty-nine to thirty-five
in Great Britain); while on no less than
475,000 acres catch crops of swedes (3,345,000
tons), carrots (155,000 tons), and more than
500,000 of lucerne and other grasses were obtained.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>As to extraordinarily heavy crops, Mr. Seebohm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Rowntree mentions, for instance, the
wheat crop in the commune of Oirbeck, near
Louvain, which was, in 1906, on the average, fifty-seven
bushels per acre, while the average of the
whole country was only thirty-four bushels, or a
yield of 111½ bushels of oats in the commune of
Neuve-Eglise, while the average for Belgium was
fifty-four bushels, and so on, the average crops of
several communes for some cereals being seventy-three
per cent. in excess of the average for Belgium,
and from 106 to 153 per cent. for roots.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>All taken, they grow in Belgium more than
76,000,000 bushels of cereals&mdash;that is, fifteen and
seven-tenths bushels per acre of the cultivable
area&mdash;while the corresponding figure for Great
Britain is only eight and a half bushels; and they
keep almost twice as many cattle upon each cultivable
acre as is kept in Great Britain.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, they even export cattle and horses.
Up to 1890 Belgium exported from 36,000 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
94,000 head of cattle, from 42,000 to 70,000
sheep, and from 60,000 to 108,600 swine. In
1890 these exports suddenly came to an end&mdash;probably
in consequence of a prohibition of
such imports into Germany. Only horses continue
to be exported to the amount of about
25,000 horses and foals every year.</p>

<p>Large portions of the land are given besides
to the culture of industrial plants, potatoes for
spirit, beet for sugar, and so on.</p>

<p>However, it must not be believed that the soil
of Belgium is more fertile than the soil of this
country. On the contrary, to use the words of
Laveleye, “only one half, or less, of the territory
offers natural conditions which are favourable
for agriculture”; the other half consists of a
gravelly soil, or sands, “the natural sterility of
which could be overpowered only by heavy
manuring.” Man, not nature, has given to the
Belgium soil its present productivity. With this
soil and labour, Belgium succeeds in supplying
nearly all the food of a population which is
denser than that of England and Wales, and
numbers 589 inhabitants to the square mile.</p>

cereals altogether, and to wheat, in Belgium. The square
which encloses the wheat square represents the area given
to both wheat and a mixture of wheat with rye.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If the exports and imports of agricultural
produce from and into Belgium be taken into
account, we can ask ourselves whether Laveleye’s
conclusions are not still good, and whether only
one inhabitant out of each ten to twenty requires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
imported food. In the years 1880-1885 the soil
of Belgium supplied with home-grown food no
less than 490 <em>inhabitants per square mile</em>, and
there remained something for export&mdash;no less
than £1,000,000 worth of agricultural produce
being exported every year to Great Britain.
But it is not possible to say with certitude
whether the conditions are the same at the
present time.</p>

</div>

<p>Since 1880, when the duties on imported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
cereals were abolished (they were before that
sixpence for each 220 lb.), and corn could be
imported free, “the importers were no more
obliged to make special declarations for merchandise
which had to be re-exported; they
declared their imports as if they were destined
to be used within the country.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
was, that while in the year 1870 the imports of
cereals were 154 lb. per head of population, the
same imports rose to 286 lb. in 1880. But no one
can say how much of these 286 lb. is consumed in
Belgium itself; and if we deduct from the total
of the imports the quantities re-exported the
same year, we obtain figures which cannot be
relied upon.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It is therefore safer to consider the
figures of the <em>annual production</em> of cereals in
Belgium, such as they are given in the official
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annuaire</cite>.</p>

<p>Now, if we take the figures given in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annuaire Statistique de la Belgique</cite> for the year
1911, we come to the following results. The
annual agricultural census, which is being
made since 1901, gives for the year 1909 that
2,290,300,000 lb. of wheat, rye, and wheat mixed
with rye were obtained on all the farms of
Belgium larger than two and a half acres
(2,002,000,000 lb. in 1895). Besides, 219,200,000
lb. of barley, 1,393,000,000 lb. of oats, and a
considerable quantity of oleaginous grains have
been produced.</p>

<p>It is generally accepted that the average
consumption of both winter and spring cereals
attains 502 lb. per head of population; and as
the population of Belgium was 7,000,000 on
January 1, 1907, it appears that no less than
3,524,400,000 lb. of cereals would have been
required to supply the annual food of the population.
If we compare this figure with that of
the annual production just mentioned, we see
then that, notwithstanding the considerable
decrease of the area given to wheat since the
abolition of the entrance duties, Belgium still
produces at least <em>two-thirds</em> of the cereal food
required for its very dense population, which is
nearly 600 persons per square mile (596 in 1907).</p>

<p>It must be noticed that we should have come
to a still higher figure if we took into account
the other cereals (to say nothing of the legumi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>nous
plants and vegetables grown and consumed
in Belgium), and still more so if we took into
account what is grown upon the small holdings
less than two and a half acres each. The number
of such small holdings was 554,041 in 1895, and
the number of people living upon them reached
nearly 2,000,000. <em>They are not included in the
official statistics, and yet upon most of them some
cereals are grown</em>, in addition to vegetables and
fodder for cattle.</p>

<p>If Belgium produces in cereals the food of
more than two-thirds of its very dense population,
this is already a quite respectable figure; but it
must also be said that it exports every year
considerable quantities of products of the soil.
Thus, in the year 1910 she exported 254,730 tons
of vegetables (as against 187,000 imported),
40,000 tons of fruit, 34,000 tons of plants and
flowers (the whole nearly £3,000,000 worth),
256,000 of oleaginous grains, 18,500 tons of wool,
nearly 60,000 tons of flax, and so on. I do not
mention the exports of butter, rabbits, skins, an
immense quantity of sugar (about 180,000 tons),
the vegetable oils and the spirits, because considerable
quantities of beet and potatoes are
imported. In short, we have here <em>an export</em>
of agricultural produce grown in the country
itself attaining the figure of 48s. per head of
population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>

<p>All taken, there is thus no possibility of contesting
the fact, that if the soil of Great Britain
were cultivated only as the unfertile soil of
Belgium is cultivated&mdash;notwithstanding all the
social obstacles which stand in the way of an
intensive culture, in Belgium as elsewhere&mdash;a
much greater part of the population of these
islands would obtain its food from the soil of its
own land than is the case nowadays.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>On the other side it must not be forgotten
that Belgium is a manufacturing country which
exports, moreover, manufactured home-made
goods to the value of 198s. per head of population,
and 150s. worth of crude or half-manufactured
produce, while the total exports from the United
Kingdom have only lately attained during the
extraordinary year of 1911 the value of 201s.
per inhabitant. As to separate parts of the
Belgian territory, the small and naturally unfertile
province of West Flanders not only grew
in 1890 the food of its 580 inhabitants on the
square mile, but exported agricultural produce
to the value of 25s. per head of its population.
And yet no one can read Laveleye’s masterly
work without coming to the conclusion that
Flemish agriculture would have realised still
better results, were it not hampered in its growth
by the steady and heavy increase of rent. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
face of the rent being increased each nine years,
many farmers have lately abstained from further
improvements.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another example of what could be achieved
by means of an effort of the nation seconded
by its educated classes is given by Denmark.
After the war of 1864, which ended in the loss
of one of their provinces, the Danes made an
effort widely to spread education amongst their
peasants, and to develop at the same time an
intensive culture of the soil. The result of these
efforts is now quite evident. The rural population
of Denmark, instead of flocking to the
towns, has been increasing: in five years,
1906-1911, it rose from 1,565,585 to 1,647,350.
Out of a total population of 2,775,100, no less
than 990,900 find their living in agriculture,
dairy work, and forestry. With a very poor
soil, they have a cultivated area a trifle below
7,000,000 acres, out of which 2,773,320 acres
are under cereals. Their wheat crops are on
the average 40<sup>6</sup>/<sub>10</sub> bushels per acre, and the
value of the home-grown food-stuffs is estimated
at £40,000,000, which makes a little
less than £6 per acre. As to their exports of
home-grown produce, they exceed the imports
by £14,483,000. The chief cause of these successes
are: A highly developed agricultural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
education, town markets accessible to all the
growers, and, above all, co-operation, which again
is a result of the effort that was made by the
educated classes after the unfortunate war of
1864.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that it is now Danish butter
which rules the prices in the London market, and
that this butter is of a high quality, which can
only be attained in co-operative creameries with
cold storage and certain uniform methods in
producing butter. But it is not generally known
that the Siberian butter, which is now imported
in immense quantities into this country, is also
a creation of the Danish co-operators. When
they began to export their butter in large quantities,
they used to import butter for their own
use from the southern parts of the West Siberian
provinces of Tobolsk and Tomsk, which are
covered with prairies very similar to those of
Winnipeg in Canada. At the outset this butter
was of a most inferior quality, as it was made by
every peasant household separately. The Danes
began therefore to teach co-operation to the
Russian peasants, and they were rapidly understood
by the intelligent population of this fertile
region. The co-operative creameries began to
spread with an astounding rapidity, without us
knowing for some time wherefrom came this
interesting movement. At the present time a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
steamer loaded with Siberian butter leaves
every week one of the Baltic ports and brings to
London many thousands of casks of Siberian
butter. If I am not wrong, Finland has also
joined lately in the same export.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Without going as far as China, I might quote
similar examples from elsewhere, especially from
Lombardy. But the above will be enough to
caution the reader against hasty conclusions
as to the impossibility of feeding 46,000,000
people from 78,000,000 acres. They also will
enable me to draw the following conclusions:
(1) If the soil of the United Kingdom were
cultivated only as it <em>was</em> forty-five years ago,
24,000,000 people, instead of 17,000,000, could
live on home-grown food; and this culture,
while giving occupation to an additional 750,000
men, would give nearly 3,000,000 wealthy home
customers to the British manufactures. (2) If
the cultivable area of the United Kingdom were
cultivated as the soil is cultivated <em>on the average</em>
in Belgium, the United Kingdom would have food
for at least 37,000,000 inhabitants; and it might
export agricultural produce without ceasing to
manufacture, so as freely to supply all the needs
of a wealthy population. And finally (3), if the
population of this country came to be doubled,
all that would be required for producing the food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
for 90,000,000 inhabitants would be to cultivate
the soil as it is cultivated in the best farms of
this country, in Lombardy, and in Flanders, and
to utilise some meadows, which at present lie
almost unproductive, in the same way as the
neighbourhoods of the big cities in France are
utilised for market-gardening. All these are
not fancy dreams, but mere realities; nothing
but the modest conclusions from what we see
round about us, without any allusion to the
agriculture of the future.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If we want, however, to know what agriculture
<em>can be</em>, and what can be grown on a
given amount of soil, we must apply for information
to such regions as the district of
Saffelare in East Flanders, the island of Jersey,
or the irrigated meadows of Lombardy, which
are mentioned in the next chapter. Or else
we may apply to the market-gardeners in this
country, or in the neighbourhoods of Paris, or
in Holland, or to the “truck farms” in America,
and so on.</p>

<p>While science devotes its chief attention to
industrial pursuits, a limited number of lovers
of nature and a legion of workers whose very
names will remain unknown to posterity have
created of late a quite new agriculture, as
superior to modern farming as modern farm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>ing
is superior to the old three-fields system of
our ancestors. Science seldom guided them,
and sometimes misguided&mdash;as was the case with
Liebig’s theories, developed to the extreme by
his followers, who induced us to treat plants
as glass recipients of chemical drugs, and who
forgot that the only science capable of dealing
with life and growth is physiology, not chemistry.
Science seldom has guided them: they proceeded
in the empirical way; but, like the
cattle-growers who opened new horizons to
biology, they have opened a new field of
experimental research for the physiology of
plants. They have created a totally new
agriculture. They smile when we boast about
the rotation system, having permitted us to
take from the field one crop every year, or four
crops each three years, because their ambition
is to have six and nine crops from the very
same plot of land during the twelve months.
They do not understand our talk about good
and bad soils, because they make the soil themselves,
and make it in such quantities as to be
compelled yearly to sell some of it: otherwise
it would raise up the level of their gardens by
half an inch every year. They aim at cropping,
not five or six tons of grass on the acre, as we
do, but from 50 to 100 tons of various vegetables
on the same space; not £5 worth of hay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
but £100 worth of vegetables, of the plainest
description, cabbage and carrots, and more
than £200 worth under intensive horticultural
treatment. This is where agriculture is going now.</p>

<p>We know that the dearest of all varieties of
our staple food is meat; and those who are
not vegetarians, either by persuasion or by
necessity, consume on the average 225 lb. of
meat&mdash;that is, roughly speaking, a little less
than the third part of an ox&mdash;every year.
And we have seen that, even in this country,
and Belgium, two to three acres are wanted for
keeping one head of horned cattle; so that a
community of, say, 1,000,000 inhabitants would
have to reserve somewhere about 1,000,000
acres of land for supplying it with meat. But
if we go to the farm of M. Goppart&mdash;one of the
promoters of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensilage</i> in France&mdash;we shall see
him growing, on a drained and well-manured
field, no less than an average of 120,000 lb. of
corn-grass to the acre, which gives 30,000 lb. of
dry hay&mdash;that is, the food of one horned beast
per acre. The produce is thus trebled.</p>

<p>As to beetroot, which is used also for feeding
cattle, Mr. Champion, at Whitby, succeeded,
with the help of sewage, in growing 100,000 lb.
of beet on each acre, and occasionally 150,000
and 200,000 lb. He thus grew on each acre
the food of, at least, two or three head of cattle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
And such crops are not isolated facts; thus, M.
Gros, at Autun, succeeds in cropping 600,000
lb. of beet and carrots, which crop would permit
him to keep four horned cattle on each acre.
In fact, crops of 100,000 lb. of beet occur in
numbers in the French competitions, and the
success depends entirely upon good culture and
appropriate manuring. It thus appears that
while under ordinary high farming we need
2,000,000 acres, or more, to keep 1,000,000
horned cattle, double that amount could be
kept on one-half of that area; and if the
density of population required it, the amount
of cattle could be doubled again, and the area
required to keep it might still be one-half, or
even one-third of what it is now.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p><em>French Gardening.</em>&mdash;The above examples are
striking enough, and yet those afforded by the
market-gardening culture are still more striking.
I mean the culture carried on in the neighbourhood
of big cities, and more especially the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culture maraîchère</i> round Paris. In this culture
each plant is treated according to its age.
The seeds germinate and the seedlings develop
their first four leaflets in especially favourable
conditions of soil and temperature; then the
best seedlings are picked out and transplanted
into a bed of fine loam, under a frame or in the
open air, where they freely develop their rootlets,
and, gathered on a limited space, receive
more than the usual care. Only after this
preliminary training are they bedded in the
open ground, where they grow till ripe. In
such a culture the primitive condition of the
soil is of little account, because loam is made
out of the old forcing beds. The seeds are
carefully tried, the seedlings receive proper
attention, and there is no fear of drought,
because of the variety of crops, the liberal
watering with the help of a steam engine,
and the stock of plants always kept ready to
replace the weakest individuals. Almost each
plant is treated individually.</p>

<p>There prevails, however, with regard to
market-gardening, a misunderstanding which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
it would be well to remove. It is generally
supposed that what chiefly attracts market-gardening
to the great centres of population
is the market. It must have been so; and so
it may be still, but to some extent only. A
great number of the Paris <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîchers</i>, even of
those who have their gardens within the walls
of the city and whose main crop consists of
vegetables in season, export the whole of their
produce to England. What chiefly attracts
the gardener to the great cities is stable manure;
and this is not wanted so much for increasing
the richness of the soil&mdash;one-tenth part of the
manure used by the French gardeners would do
for that purpose&mdash;but for keeping the soil at
a certain temperature. Early vegetables pay
best, and in order to obtain early produce not
only the air but the soil as well must be warmed;
and this is done by putting great quantities of
properly mixed manure into the soil; its
fermentation heats it. But it is evident that
with the present development of industrial
skill, the heating of the soil could be obtained
more economically and more easily by hot-water
pipes. Consequently, the French gardeners
begin more and more to make use of
portable pipes, or <em>thermosiphons</em>, provisionally
established in the cool frames. This new improvement
becomes of general use, and we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the authority of Barral’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire d’Agriculture</cite>
to affirm that it gives excellent results.
Under this system stable manure is used mainly
for producing loam.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>As to the different degrees of fertility of the
soil&mdash;always the stumbling-block of those who
write about agriculture&mdash;the fact is that in
market-gardening the soil is always <em>made</em>, whatever
it originally may have been. Consequently&mdash;we
are told by Prof. Dybowski, in the
article “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maraîchers</span>” in Barral’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire
d’Agriculture</cite>&mdash;it is now a usual stipulation of
the renting contracts of the Paris <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîchers</i>
that the gardener may carry away his soil,
down to a certain depth, when he quits his
tenancy. He himself makes it, and when he
moves to another plot he carts his soil away,
together with his frames, his water-pipes, and
his other belongings.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>I could not relate here all the marvels achieved
in market-gardening; so that I must refer the
reader to works&mdash;most interesting works&mdash;especially
devoted to the subject, and give
only a few illustrations.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Let us take, for
instance, the orchard&mdash;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marais</i>&mdash;of M. Ponce,
the author of a well-known work on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
maraîchère</i>. His orchard covered only two and
seven-tenths acres. The outlay for the establishment,
including a steam engine for watering
purposes, reached £1,136. Eight persons, M.
Ponce included, cultivated the orchard and
carried the vegetables to the market, for which
purpose one horse was kept; when returning
from Paris they brought in manure, for which
£100 was spent every year. Another £100 was
spent in rent and taxes. But how to enumerate
all that was gathered every year on this plot of
less than three acres, without filling two pages
or more with the most wonderful figures? One
must read them in M. Ponce’s work, but here
are the chief items: More than 20,000 lb. of
carrots; more than 20,000 lb. of onions, radishes
and other vegetables sold by weight; 6,000
heads of cabbage; 3,000 of cauliflower; 5,000
baskets of tomatoes; 5,000 dozen of choice
fruit; and 154,000 heads of salad; in short,
a total of 250,000 lb. of vegetables. The soil
was made to such an amount out of forcing
beds that every year 250 cubic yards of loam
had to be sold. Similar examples could be
given by the dozen, and the best evidence
against any possible exaggeration of the results
is the very high rent paid by the gardeners,
which reaches in the suburbs of London from
£10 to £15 per acre, and in the suburbs of Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
attains as much as £32 per acre. No less than
2,125 acres are cultivated round Paris in that
way by 5,000 persons, and thus not only the
2,000,000 Parisians are supplied with vegetables,
but the surplus is also sent to London.</p>

<p>The above results are obtained with the help
of warm frames, thousands of glass bells, and
so on. But even without such costly things,
with only thirty-six yards of frames for seedlings,
vegetables are grown <em>in the open air</em> to the
value of £200 per acre.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It is obvious, however,
that in such cases the high selling prices of
the crops are not due to the high prices fetched
by early vegetables in winter; they are entirely
due to the high crops of the plainest ones.</p>

<p>Let me add also that all this wonderful
culture has entirely developed in the second
half of the nineteenth century. Before that,
it was quite primitive. But now the Paris
gardener not only defies the soil&mdash;he would
grow the same crops on an asphalt pavement&mdash;he
defies climate. His walls, which are built
to reflect light and to protect the wall-trees
from the northern winds, his wall-tree shades
and glass protectors, his frames and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pépinières</i>
have made a real garden, a rich Southern
garden, out of the suburbs of Paris. He has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
given to Paris the “two degrees less of latitude”
after which a French scientific writer was
longing; he supplies his city with mountains
of grapes and fruit at any season; and in the
early spring he inundates and perfumes it
with flowers. But he does not only grow articles
of luxury. The culture of plain vegetables on
a large scale is spreading every year; and the
results are so good that there are now practical
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîchers</i> who venture to maintain that if all
the food, animal and vegetable, necessary for
4,500,000 inhabitants of the departments of
Seine and Seine-et-Oise had to be grown on
their own territory (3,250 square miles), it
could be grown without resorting to any other
methods of culture than those already in use&mdash;methods
already tested on a large scale and
proved to be successful.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And yet the Paris gardener is not our ideal
of an agriculturist. In the painful work of
civilisation he has shown us the way to follow;
but the ideal of modern civilisation is elsewhere.
He toils, with but a short interruption,
from three in the morning till late in the
night. He knows no leisure; he has no time
to live the life of a human being; the commonwealth
does not exist for him; his world is
his garden, more than his family. He cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
be our ideal; neither he nor his system of
agriculture. Our ambition is, that he should
produce even <em>more</em> than he does with <em>less</em>
labour, and should enjoy all the joys of human
life. And this is fully possible.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, if we put aside those
gardeners who chiefly cultivate the so-called
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">primeurs</i>&mdash;strawberries ripened in January, and
the like&mdash;if we take only those who grow their
crops in the open field, and resort to frames
exclusively for the earlier days of the life of
the plant, and if we analyse their system, we see
that its very essence is, first, to create for the
plant a nutritive and porous soil, which contains
both the necessary decaying organic
matter and the inorganic compounds; and then
to keep that soil and the surrounding atmosphere
at a temperature and moisture superior to
those of the open air. The whole system is
summed up in these few words. If the French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîcher</i> spends prodigies of labour, intelligence,
and imagination in combining different
kinds of manure, so as to make them ferment
at a given speed, he does so for no purpose but
the above: a nourishing soil, and a desired
equal temperature and moisture of the air and
the soil. All his empirical art is devoted to the
achievement of these two aims. But both can
also be achieved in another and much easier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
way. The soil can be <em>improved</em> by hand, but
it need not be <em>made</em> by hand. Any soil, of any
desired composition, can be made by machinery.
We already have manufactures of manure,
engines for pulverising the phosphorites, and
even the granites of the Vosges; and we shall
see manufactures of loam as soon as there is a
demand for them.</p>

<p>It is obvious that at present, when fraud and
adulteration are exercised on such an immense
scale in the manufacture of artificial manure,
and the manufacture of manure is considered
as a chemical process, while it ought to be
considered as a physiological one, the gardener
prefers to spend an unimaginable amount of
labour rather than risk his crop by the use of a
pompously labelled and unworthy drug. But
that is a social obstacle which depends upon a
want of knowledge and a bad social organisation,
not upon physical causes.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span></p>

<p>Of course, the necessity of creating for the
earlier life of the plant a warm soil and atmosphere
will always remain, and sixty years ago
Léonce de Lavergne foretold that the next step
in culture would be to warm the soil. But
heating pipes give the same results as the
fermenting manures at a much smaller expense
of human labour. And already the system
works on a large scale, as will be seen from
the next chapter. Through it the productive
powers of a given area of land are increased
more than a hundred times.</p>

<p>It is obvious that now, when the capitalist
system makes us pay for everything three or
four times its labour value, we often spend
about £1 for each square yard of a heated
conservatory. But how many middlemen are
making fortunes on the wooden sashes imported
from Drontheim? If we only could reckon our
expenses in labour, we should discover to our
amazement that, thanks to the use of machinery,
the square yard of a conservatory does not
cost more than half a day of human labour;
and we will see presently that the Jersey and
Guernsey average for cultivating one acre under
glass is only three men working ten hours a day.
Therefore the conservatory, which formerly was
a luxury, is rapidly entering into the domain
of high culture. And we may foresee the day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
when the glass conservatory will be considered
as a necessary appendix to the field, both for
the growth of those fruits and vegetables
which cannot succeed in the open air, and for
the preliminary training of most cultural plants
during the earlier stages of their life.</p>

<p>Home-grown fruit is always preferable to the
half-ripe produce which is imported from
abroad, and the additional work required for
keeping a young plant under glass is largely
repaid by the incomparable superiority of the
crops. As to the question of labour, when we
remember the incredible amount of labour
which has been spent on the Rhine and in
Switzerland for making the vineyards, their
terraces, and stone walls, and for carrying the
soil up the stony crags, as also the amount of
labour which is spent every year for the culture
of those vineyards and fruit gardens, we are
inclined to ask, which of the two, all taken, requires
less of human labour&mdash;a vinery (I mean
the cold vinery) in a London suburb, or a vineyard
on the Rhine, or on Lake Leman? And
when we compare the prices realised by the
grower of grapes round London (not those which
are paid in the West-end fruit shops, but those
received by the grower for his grapes in September
and October) with those current in Switzerland
or on the Rhine during the same months,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
we are inclined to maintain that nowhere in
Europe, beyond the forty-fifth degree of latitude,
are grapes grown at less expense of human
labour, both for capital outlay and yearly work,
than in the vineries of the London and Brussels
suburbs.</p>

<p>At any rate, let us not overrate the productivity
of the exporting countries, and let
us remember that the vine-growers of Southern
Europe drink themselves an abominable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquette</i>;
that Marseilles fabricates wine for home use out
of dry raisins brought from Asia; and that the
Normandy peasant who sends his apples to
London, drinks real cider only on great festivities.
Such a state of things will not last
for ever; and the day is not far when we shall
be compelled to look to our own resources to provide
many of the things which we now import.
And we shall not be the worse for that. The
resources of science, both in enlarging the circle
of our production and in new discoveries, are
inexhaustible. And each new branch of activity
calls into existence more and more new branches,
which steadily increase the power of man over
the forces of nature.</p>

<p>If we take all into consideration; if we
realise the progress made of late in the gardening
culture, and the tendency towards spreading
its methods to the open field; if we watch the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
cultural experiments which are being made
now&mdash;experiments to-day and realities to-morrow&mdash;and
ponder over the resources kept
in store by science, we are bound to say that
<em>it is utterly impossible to foresee at the present
moment the limits as to the</em> maximum <em>number
of human beings who could draw their means of
subsistence from a given area of land</em>, or as to
what a variety of produce they could advantageously
grow in any latitude. Each day widens
former limits, and opens new and wide horizons.
All we can say now is, that, <em>even now</em>, 600
persons could easily live on a square mile;
and that, with cultural methods already used
on a large scale, 1,000 human beings&mdash;not
idlers&mdash;living on 1,000 acres could easily,
without any kind of overwork, obtain from
that area a luxurious vegetable and animal
food, as well as the flax, wool, silk, and hides
necessary for their clothing. As to what may
be obtained under still more perfect methods&mdash;also
known but not yet tested on a large scale&mdash;it
is better to abstain from any forecast:
so unexpected are the recent achievements of
intensive culture.</p>

<p>We thus see that the over-population fallacy
does not stand the very first attempt at submitting
it to a closer examination. Those only
can be horror-stricken at seeing the population<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
of this country increase by one individual
every 1,000 seconds who think of a human
being as a mere claimant upon the stock of
material wealth of mankind, without being at
the same time a contributor to that stock.
But we, who see in each new-born babe a
future <em>worker</em> capable of producing much
more than his own share of the common stock&mdash;we
greet his appearance.</p>

<p>We know that a crowded population is a
necessary condition for permitting man to increase
the productive powers of his labour. We
know that highly productive labour is impossible
so long as men are scattered, few in numbers,
over wide territories, and are thus unable to
combine together for the higher achievements
of civilisation. We know what an amount of
labour must be spent to scratch the soil with a
primitive plough, to spin and weave by hand;
and we know also how much less labour it
costs to grow the same amount of food and
weave the same cloth with the help of modern
machinery.</p>

<p>We also see that it is infinitely easier to
grow 200,000 lb. of food on one acre than to
grow them on ten acres. It is all very well
to imagine that wheat grows by itself on the
Russian steppes; but those who have seen
how the peasant toils in the “fertile” black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
earth region will have one desire: that the
increase of population may permit the use of
the steam-digger and gardening culture in the
steppes; that it may permit those who are
now the beasts of burden of humanity to raise
their backs and to become at last men.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We must, however, recognise that there are
a few economists fully aware of the above
truths. They gladly admit that Western
Europe could grow much more food than it
does; but they see no necessity nor advantage
in doing so, as long as there are nations
which can supply food in exchange for manufactured
goods. Let us then examine how far
this view is correct.</p>

<p>It is obvious that if we are satisfied with
merely stating that it is cheaper to bring wheat
from Riga than to grow it in Lincolnshire, the
whole question is settled in a moment. But
is it so in reality? Is it really cheaper to have
food from abroad? And, supposing it is, are
we not yet bound to analyse that compound
result which we call price, rather than to accept
it as a supreme and blind ruler of our actions?</p>

<p>We know, for instance, how French agriculture
is burdened by taxation. And yet, if we
compare the prices of articles of food in France,
which herself grows most of them, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
prices in this country, which imports them,
we find no difference in favour of the importing
country. On the contrary, the balance is
rather in favour of France, and it decidedly
was so for wheat until the new protective tariff
was introduced. As soon as one goes out of
Paris, one finds that every <em>home produce</em> is
cheaper in France than it is in England, and
that the prices decrease further when we go
farther East on the Continent.</p>

<p>There is another feature still more unfavourable
for this country: namely, the enormous
development of the class of middlemen who
stand between the importer and the home
producer on the one side and the consumer
on the other. We have lately heard a good
deal about the quite disproportionate part of
the prices we pay which goes into the middleman’s
pockets. We have all heard of the
East-end clergyman who was compelled to
become butcher in order to save his parishioners
from the greedy middleman. We read
in the papers that many farmers of the midland
counties do not realise more than 9d. for a
pound of butter, while the customer pays from
1s. 6d. to 1s. 8d.; and that from 1½d. to 2d. for
the quart of milk is all that the Cheshire farmers
can get, while we pay 4d. for the adulterated,
and 5d. for the unadulterated milk. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
analysis of the Covent Garden prices and a
comparison of the same with retail prices, which
is being made from time to time in the daily
papers, proves that the customer pays for
vegetables at the rate of 6d. to 1s., and sometimes
more, for each penny realised by the
grower. But in a country of imported food
it <em>must</em> be so: the grower who himself sells
his own produce disappears from its markets,
and in his place appears the middleman.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> If
we move, however, towards the East, and go to
Belgium, Germany, and Russia, we find that
the cost of living is more and more reduced,
so that finally we find that in Russia, which
remains still agricultural, wheat costs one-half
or two-thirds of its London prices, and meat
is sold throughout the provinces at about
ten farthings (kopecks) the pound. And we
may therefore hold that it is not yet proved at
all that it is cheaper to live on imported food
than to grow it ourselves.</p>

<p>But if we analyse <em>price</em>, and make a distinction
between its different elements, the disadvantage
becomes still more apparent. If we compare,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
for instance, the costs of growing wheat in this
country and in Russia, we are told that in the
United Kingdom the hundredweight of wheat
cannot be grown at less than 8s. 7d.; while in
Russia the costs of production of the same hundredweight
are estimated at from 3s. 6d. to
4s. 9d.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The difference is enormous, and it
would still remain very great even if we admit
that there is some exaggeration in the former
figure. But why this difference? Are the Russian
labourers paid so much less for their work?
Their money wages surely are much lower, but
the difference is equalised as soon as we reckon
their wages in produce. The twelve shillings a
week of the British agricultural labourer represents
the same amount of wheat in Britain as
the six shillings a week of the Russian labourer
represents in Russia. As to the supposed prodigious
fertility of the soil in the Russian prairies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
it is a fallacy. Crops of from sixteen to twenty-three
bushels per acre are considered good crops
in Russia, while the average hardly reaches
thirteen bushels, even in the corn-exporting parts
of the empire. <ins class="corr" id="tn-142" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Besides, the amout'">
Besides, the amount</ins> of labour
which is necessary to grow wheat in Russia with
no thrashing-machines, with a plough dragged
by a horse hardly worth the name, with no roads
for transport, and so on, is certainly much greater
than the amount of labour which is necessary
to grow the same amount of wheat in Western
Europe.</p>

<p>When brought to the London market, Russian
wheat was sold in 1887 at 31s. the quarter, while
it appeared from the same <cite>Mark Lane Express</cite>
figures that the quarter of wheat could not be
grown in this country at less than 36s. 8d., even
if the straw be sold, which is not always the
case. But the difference of the land rent in
both countries would alone account for the difference
of prices. In the wheat belt of Russia, where
the average rent stood at about 12s. per acre,
and the crop was from fifteen to twenty bushels,
the rent amounted to from 3s. 6d. to 5s. 8d. in the
costs of production of each quarter of Russian
wheat; while in this country, where the rent and
taxes are valued (in the <cite>Mark Lane Express</cite>
figures) at no less than 40s. per each wheat-growing
acre, and the crop is taken at thirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
bushels, the rent amounts to 10s. in the costs of
production of each quarter.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> But even if we
take only 30s. per acre of rent and taxes, and an
average crop of twenty-eight bushels, we still
have 8s. 8d. out of the sale price of each quarter
of wheat, which goes to the landlord and the
State. If it costs so much more in money to
grow wheat in this country, while the amount of
labour is so much less in this country than in
Russia, it is due to the very great height of the
land rents attained during the years 1860-1880.
But this growth itself was due to the facilities
for realising large profits on the sale of manufactured
goods abroad. The false condition of
British rural economy, not the infertility of the
soil, is thus the chief cause of the Russian
competition.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years have passed since I wrote
these lines&mdash;the agricultural crisis provoked by
the competition of cheap American wheat being
at that time at its climax, and, I am sorry to
say, I must leave these lines such as they were
written. I do not mean, of course, that no
adaptation to the new conditions created by the
fall in the prices of wheat should have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
place during the last quarter of a century, in the
sense of a more intensive culture and a better
utilisation of the land. On the contrary, I mention
in different parts of this book the progress
accomplished of late in the development of
separate branches of intensive culture, such as
fruit-culture, market-gardening, culture under
glass, French gardening, and poultry farming,
and I also indicate the different steps taken to
promote further improvements, such as better
conditions of transport, co-operation among the
farmers, and especially the development of small
holdings.</p>

<p>However, after having taken into account all
these improvements, one cannot but see with
regret that the same regressive movement in
British agriculture, which began in the ’seventies,
continues still; and while more and more of
the land that was once under the plough goes
out of culture, no corresponding increase in the
quantities of live stock is to be seen. And if we
consult the mass of books and review articles
which have been dealing lately with this subject,
we see that all the writers recognise that British
agriculture <em>must</em> adapt itself to the new conditions
by a thorough reform of its general character;
and yet the same writers recognise that only a
few steps were taken till now in the proper direction,
and none of them was taken with a sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
energy. Society at large remains indifferent to
the needs of British agriculture.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the competition
of American wheat has made the same havoc
in the agriculture of most European countries&mdash;especially
in France and Belgium; but in the
last two countries the adaptations which were
necessary to resist the effects of the competition
have already taken place to a great extent.
Both in Belgium and in France the American
imports gave a new impetus toward a more
intensive utilisation of the soil, and this impetus
was strongest in Belgium, where no attempt was
made to protect agriculture by an increase of the
import duties, as was the case in France. On the
contrary, the duties upon imported wheat were
abolished in Belgium precisely at the time when
the American competition began to be felt&mdash;that
is, between 1870 and 1880.</p>

<p>It was not only in England that the fall in the
prices of wheat was felt acutely by the farmers.
In France, the hectolitre of wheat (very nearly
three bushels), which was sold at 18s. 10d. in
1871-1875, fell to 15s. 5d. in 1881-1885, and to
12s. 6d. in 1893; and the same must have been
in Belgium, the more so as the protective duties
were abolished. But here is what Mr. Seebohm
Rowntree says about the effect of the prices in his
admirable book on land and labour in Belgium:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span></p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“For a time the Belgian agriculturist was hardly hit, but
gradually he adjusted himself to the new conditions. His
cultivation became more intensive, he made more and more
use of co-operation in various directions, and he devoted himself
to new branches of agriculture, especially the raising of live
stock and garden produce. He began to realise the value of
artificial manures, and to acknowledge that science could help
him.”&mdash;<cite>Land and Labour</cite>, p. 147.</p>
</div>

<p>These words by Mr. Rowntree are fully confirmed
by the change in the general aspects of
the Belgian agriculture, as they appear from
the official statistical data. The same must
be said of France. The above-mentioned fall
in prices induced agriculturists to intensify their
methods of culture. I have mentioned already
the rapid spreading of agricultural machinery
among the French peasants during the last
twenty years; and I must mention also the
equally remarkable increase in the amounts of
chemical manure used by the peasants; the
sudden development of agricultural syndicates
since 1884; the extension taken by co-operation;
the new organisation of transport with
cool storage, or in heated cars, for the export
of fruit and flowers; the development taken
by special industrial cultures; and still more so
the immense development of gardening in the
South of France and market-gardening in the
North. All these adaptations were introduced
on such a scale that one is bound to recognise
that the crisis has had the effect of giving quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
a new aspect to French agriculture, taken as a
whole.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much more ought to be said with regard to
the American competition, and therefore I must
refer the reader to the remarkable series of
articles dealing with the whole of the subject
which Schaeffle published in 1886 in the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift
für die gesammte Staatswissenschaft</cite>, and
to the most elaborate article on the costs of
growing wheat all over the world which appeared
in April, 1887, in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>. These
articles were written at the time when American
competition was something new and made much
havoc in English agriculture, causing a fall of
from 30 to 50 per cent. in the rents of land
for agricultural purposes. But the conclusions
of these two writers were fully corroborated
by the yearly reports of the American Board of
Agriculture, and Schaeffle’s previsions were
fully confirmed by the subsequent reports of
Mr. J. R. Dodge. It appeared from these works
that the fertility of the American soil had been
grossly exaggerated, as the masses of wheat which
America sent to Europe from its north-western
farms were grown on a soil the natural fertility
of which is not higher, and often lower, than the
average fertility of the unmanured European
soil. The Casselton farm in Dakota, with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
twenty bushels per acre, was an exception; while
the average crop of the chief wheat-growing
States in the West was only eleven to twelve
bushels. In order to find a fertile soil in
America, and crops of from thirty to forty bushels,
one must go to the old Eastern States, where the
soil is made by man’s hands.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The same applies to the American supplies of
meat. Schaeffle pointed out that the great mass
of live stock which appeared in the census of
cattle in the States was not reared in the prairies,
but in the stables of the farms, in the same way
as in Europe; as to the prairies, he found on them
only one-eleventh part of the American horned
cattle, one-fifth of the sheep and one-twenty-first
of the pigs.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> “Natural fertility” being thus
out of question, we must look for social causes;
and we have them, for the Western States, in
the cheapness of land and a proper organisation
of production; and for the Eastern States in
the rapid progress of <em>intensive</em> high farming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<p>It is evident that the methods of culture must
vary according to different conditions. In the
vast prairies of North America, where land could
be <em>bought</em> from 8s. to 40s. the acre, and where
spaces of from 100 to 150 square miles in one
block could be given to wheat culture, special
methods of culture were applied and the results
were excellent. Land was bought&mdash;not rented.
In the autumn, whole studs of horses were brought,
and the tilling and sowing were done with the
aid of formidable ploughs and sowing machines.
Then the horses were sent to graze in the mountains;
the men were dismissed, and one man,
occasionally two or three, remained to winter
on the farm. In the spring the owners’ agents
began to beat the inns for hundreds of miles
round, and engaged labourers and tramps, both
freely supplied by Europe, for the crop. Battalions
of men were marched to the wheat fields,
and were camped there; the horses were brought
from the mountains, and in a week or two the
crop was cut, thrashed, winnowed, put in sacks,
by specially invented machines, and sent to the
next elevator, or directly to the ships which
carried it to Europe. Whereupon the men
were disbanded again, the horses were sent back
to the grazing grounds, or sold, and again only
a couple of men remained on the farm.</p>

<p>The crop from each acre was small, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
machinery was so perfected that in this way
300 days of one man’s labour produced from
200 to 300 quarters of wheat; in other words&mdash;the
area of land being of no account&mdash;every man
produced in one day his yearly bread food (eight
and a half bushels of wheat); and taking into
account all subsequent labour, it was calculated
that the work of 300 men in one single day delivered
to the consumer at Chicago the flour that is
required for the yearly food of 250 persons.
Twelve hours and a half of work are thus required
in Chicago to supply one man with his yearly
provision of wheat-flour.</p>

<p>Under the special conditions offered in the
Far West this certainly was an appropriate
method for increasing all of a sudden the wheat
supplies of mankind. It answered its purpose
when large territories of unoccupied land were
opened to enterprise. But it could not answer
for ever. Under such a system of culture the
soil was soon exhausted, the crop declined, and
<em>intensive</em> agriculture (which aims at high crops on
a limited area) had soon to be resorted to. Such
was the case in Iowa in the year 1878. Up till
then, Iowa was an emporium for wheat-growing
on the lines just indicated. But the soil was
already exhausted, and when a disease came the
wheat plants had no force to resist it. In a few
weeks nearly all the wheat crop, which was ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>pected
to beat all previous records, was lost;
eight to ten bushels per acre of bad wheat were
all that could be cropped. The result was that
“mammoth farms” had to be broken up into
small farms, and that the Iowa farmers (after a
terrible crisis of short duration&mdash;everything is
rapid in America) took to a more intensive
culture. Now, they are not behind France in
wheat culture, as they already grow an average
of sixteen and a half bushels per acre on an area
of more than 2,000,000 acres, and they will soon
win ground. Somehow, with the aid of manure
and improved methods of farming, they compete
admirably with the mammoth farms of the Far
West.</p>

<p>In fact, over and over again it was pointed
out, by Schaeffle, Semler, Oetken, and many other
writers, that the force of “American competition”
is not in its mammoth farms, but in the
countless small farms upon which wheat is grown
in the same way as it is grown in Europe&mdash;that
is, with manuring&mdash;but with a better organised
production and facilities for sale, and without being
compelled to pay to the landlord a toll of one-third
part, or more, of the selling price of each
quarter of wheat. However, it was only after I
had myself made a tour in the prairies of Manitoba
in 1897, and those of Ohio in 1901, that I
could realise the full truth of the just-mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
views. The 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 bushels
of wheat, which are exported every year from
Manitoba, are grown almost entirely in farms
of one or two “quarter-sections”&mdash;that is, of
160 and 320 acres. The ploughing is made in the
usual way, and in an immense majority of cases
the farmers buy the reaping and binding machines
(the “binders”) by associating in groups of
four. The thrashing machine is rented by the
farmer for one or two days, and the farmer carts
his wheat to the elevator with his own horses,
either to sell it immediately, or to keep it at the
elevator if he is in no immediate need of money
and hopes to get a higher price in one month or
two. In short, in Manitoba one is especially
struck with the fact that, even under a system
of keen competition, the middle-size farm has
completely beaten the old mammoth farm,
and that it is not manufacturing wheat on a
grand scale which pays best. It is also most interesting
to note that thousands and thousands
of farmers produce mountains of wheat in the
Canadian province of Toronto and in the Eastern
States, although the land is not prairie-land at
all, and the farms are, as a rule, small.</p>

<p>The force of “American competition” is thus
not in the possibility of having hundreds of acres
of wheat in one block. It lies in the ownership
of the land, in a system of culture which is ap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>propriate
to the character of the country, in
a widely developed spirit of association, and,
finally, in a number of institutions and customs
intended to lift the agriculturist and his profession
to a high level which is unknown in Europe.</p>

<p>In Europe we do not realise at all what is
done in the States and Canada in the interests
of agriculture. In every American State, and
in every distinct region of Canada, there is an
experimental farm, and all the work of preliminary
experiment upon new varieties of
wheat, oats, barley, fodder and fruit, which the
farmer has mostly to make himself in Europe, is
made under the best scientific conditions at the
experimental farms, on a small scale first and
on a large scale next. The results of all these
researches and experiments are not merely
rendered accessible to the farmer who would like
to know them, but they are brought to his
knowledge, and, so to speak, are forced upon his
attention by every possible means. The “Bulletins”
of the experimental stations are distributed
in hundreds of thousands of copies;
visits to the farms are organised in such a way
that thousands of farmers should inspect the
stations every year, and be shown by specialists
the results obtained, either with new varieties
of plants or under various new methods of treatment.
Correspondence is carried on with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
farmers on such a scale that, for instance, at
Ottawa, the experimental farm sends out every
year a hundred thousand letters and packets.
Every farmer can get, free of charge and postage,
five pounds of seed of any variety of cereals,
out of which he can get next year the necessary
seed for sowing several acres. And, finally, in
every small and remote township there are held
farmers’ meetings, at which special lecturers,
who are sent out by the experimental farms or
the local agricultural societies, discuss with the
farmers in an informal way the results of last
year’s experiments and discoveries relative to
every branch of agriculture, horticulture, cattle-breeding,
dairying and agricultural co-operation.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>American agriculture really offers an imposing
sight&mdash;not in the wheat fields of the Far West,
which soon will become a thing of the past, but
in the development of rational agriculture and
the forces which promote it. Read the description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
of an agricultural exhibition, “the State’s
fair,” in some small town of Iowa, with its
70,000 farmers camping with their families in
tents during the fair’s week, studying, learning,
buying, and selling, and enjoying life. You see
a <em>national</em> fête, and you feel that you deal with
a nation in which agriculture is in respect. Or
read the publications of the scores of experimental
stations, whose reports are distributed broadcast
over the country, and are read by the farmers and
discussed at countless “farmers’ meetings.”
Consult the “Transactions” and “Bulletins”
of the countless agricultural societies, not royal
but popular; study the grand enterprises for
irrigation; and you will feel that American
agriculture is a real force, imbued with life, which
no longer fears mammoth farms, and needs not
to cry like a child for protection.</p>

<p>“Intensive” agriculture and gardening are
already by this time as much a feature of the
treatment of the soil in America as they are in
Belgium. As far back as the year 1880, nine
States, among which were Georgia, Virginia and
the two Carolinas, bought £5,750,000 worth of
artificial manure; and we are told that by this
time the use of artificial manure has immensely
spread towards the West. In Iowa, where
mammoth farms used to exist twenty years
ago, sown grass is already in use, and it is highly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
recommended by both the Iowa Agricultural
Institute and the numerous local agricultural
papers; while at the agricultural competitions
the highest rewards are given, not for extensive
farming, but for high crops on small areas.
Thus, at a recent competition in which hundreds
of farmers took part, the first ten prizes were
awarded to ten farmers who had grown, on three
acres each, from 262 to 346¾ bushels of Indian
corn, in other words <em>from 87 to 115 bushels to
the acre</em>. This shows where the ambition of the
Iowa farmer goes. In Minnesota, prizes were
given already for crops of 300 to 1,120 bushels
of potatoes to the acre&mdash;that is, from eight and
a quarter to thirty-one tons to the acre&mdash;while
the average potato crop in Great Britain is
only six tons.</p>

<p>At the same time market-gardening is immensely
extending in America. In the market-gardens
of Florida we see such crops as 445 to
600 bushels of onions per acre, 400 bushels of
tomatoes, 700 bushels of sweet potatoes, which
testify to a high development of culture. As to
the “truck farms” (market-gardening for export
by steamer and rail), they covered, in 1892,
400,000 acres, and the fruit farms in the suburbs
of Norfolk, in Virginia, were described by Prof.
Ch. Baltet<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> as real <em>models</em> of that sort of culture&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
very high testimony in the mouth of a
French gardener who himself comes from the
model <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marais</i> of Troyes.</p>

<p>And while people in London continue to pay
almost all the year round twopence for a lettuce
(very often imported from Paris), they have at
Chicago and Boston those unique establishments
in the world where lettuces are grown in immense
greenhouses with the aid of electric light; and
we must not forget that although the discovery
of “electric” growth is European (it is due to
Siemens), it was at the Cornell University that
it was proved by a series of experiments that
electric light is an admirable aid for forwarding
the growth of the <em>green</em> parts of the plant.</p>

<p>In short, America, which formerly took the
lead in bringing “extensive” agriculture to
perfection, now takes the lead in “intensive,”
or forced, agriculture as well. In this adaptability
lies the real force of American competition.</p>

another, about 300 acres, two men and two boys; a third,
800 acres, five men only and probably as many boys. In
truth, the problem of cultivating the land with the least number
of men has been solved in this spot by not cultivating at all
as much as two-thirds of it. Since these lines were written, in
1890, a movement in favour of intensive market-gardening has
begun in this country, and I read in November, 1909, that they
were selling at the Covent Garden market asparagus that had
been grown in South Devon in November. They begin also to
grow early potatoes in Cornwall and Devon. Formerly, nobody
thought of utilising this rich soil and warm climate for
growing early vegetables.</p>

about 300,000 under beans, and about 52,000 acres under rye
and buckwheat. From 540,000 to 570,000 acres were given to

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> Each 1,000 acres of French territory are disposed of as
follows: 379 acres are under woods and coppices (176), buildings,
communal grazing grounds, mountains, etc., and 621 acres
are considered as “cultivable.” Out of the latter, 130 are under
meadows, now irrigated to a great extent, 257 acres under
cereals (124 under wheat, and 26 under wheat mixed with rye),
33 under vineyards, 83 under orchards, green crops, and
various industrial cultures, and the remainder is chiefly under
permanent pasture or bare fallow. As to cattle, we find in
Great Britain, in 1910, which was an average year, 7,037,330
head of cattle (including in that number about 1,400,000
calves under one year), which makes <em>twenty-two head</em> per each
100 acres of the cultivable area, and 27,103,000 sheep&mdash;that is,
<em>eighty-four sheep</em> per each 100 acres of the same area. In
France we find, in the same year, 14,297,570 cattle (<em>nineteen</em>
head per each 100 acres of cultivable area), and only 17,357,640
sheep (<em>twenty-one</em> sheep per 100 acres of the same). In other
words, the proportion of horned cattle is nearly the same in
both countries (twenty-two head and nineteen head per 100
acres), a considerable difference appearing in favour of this
country only as to the number of sheep (eighty-four as against
twenty-one). The heavy imports of hay, oil-cake, oats, etc.,
into this country must, however, not be forgotten, because,
for each head of cattle which lives on imported food, eight
sheep can be grazed, or be fed with home-grown fodder. As
to horses, both countries stand on nearly the same footing.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_51" href="#FNanchor_51" class="label">[51]</a> Out of each 1000 acres of territory, 673 are cultivated, and
327 are left as uncultivable, and part of them are now used for
afforestation. Out of the 673 cultivated acres, 273 are given
to cereals, out of which 61 are under pure wheat, 114 under
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">méteil</i> (a mixture of ⅔ of wheat and ⅓ of rye) and pure rye, and
98 under other cereals; 18 to potatoes, 45 to roots and fodder,

grains, etc.); 27 are under gardens, kitchen gardens
and parks, 177 under woods, and 57 are cultivated periodically.
On the other hand, each 65 acres out of 1000 give
catch-crops of carrots, mangolds, etc.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">[55]</a> I take these lines from a letter which the Rural Office of
the Belgian Ministry of Agriculture had been kind enough to
write to me on January 28, 1910, in reply to some questions
which I had addressed to that Office in order to explain the
striking oscillations of the Belgian exports between the years
1870 and 1880. A Belgian friend, having kindly taken new

from another official source.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="label">[56]</a> If we take the figures of imports and exports, which I also
owe to the Belgian Rural Office, we find that the <em>net</em> imports
of wheat, rye, and wheat mixed with rye (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">méteil</i>) reached 3,011
million lb. in 1907 (3,374 million in 1910), which would give
429 lb. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per capita</i> for a population of 7,000,000 inhabitants.
But if this amount be added to the local production of the same
cereals, which reached the same year 2,426 million lb., we arrive
at the figure of 776 lb. per head of population. But such a
figure is much too high, because the annual <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per capita</i> consumption
<em>of both the winter and the spring cereals</em> is generally
estimated to be 502 lb. There must be, therefore, either an
error in the weight of the imports, which is improbable, or the
figures of re-exported cereals are not complete. Let me add that
in France the average annual consumption <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per capita</i> of <em>all</em>
cereals, including oats, has been in the course of twenty-nine
years (1880-1908) 525 lb., which confirms the above-mentioned
figure. And in France people eat as much bread as in
Belgium.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_60" href="#FNanchor_60" class="label">[60]</a> “Portable soil” is not the latest departure in agriculture.
The last one is the watering of the soil with special liquids
containing special microbes. It is a fact that chemical manures,
without organic manure, seldom prove to be sufficient. On
the other hand, it was discovered lately that certain microbes
in the soil are a necessary condition for the growth of plants.
Hence the idea of <em>sowing</em> the beneficent microbes, which rapidly
develop in the soil and fertilise it. We certainly shall soon
hear more of this new method, which is experimented upon on
a large scale in Germany, in order to transform peat-bogs

excellent English manuals, but I must remark that the market-gardening
culture in this country has also obtained results very
highly prized by the Continental gardeners, and that the chief
reproach to be addressed to it is its relatively small extension.
French market-gardening having been lately introduced into
England, several manuals have been published for that purpose.
The little work, <cite>French Gardening</cite>, by Thomas Smith,
London (Utopia Press), 1909, deserves special mention, as it
contains the results of one year’s observation of the work
of a French gardener, specially invited to England by Mr.
Joseph Fels, and gives (with illustrations) a mass of practical
indications and numerical data as to the cost and the
value of the produce. A subsequent work of the same author,
<cite>The Profitable Culture of Vegetables for Market Gardeners, Small
Holders, and Others</cite>, London (Longmans, Green), 1911, deals in
detail with the ordinary culture of vegetables and the intensive
culture of the French gardeners.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[67]</a> L. de Lavergne pointed out as far back as fifty years
ago that the States were at that time the chief importers of
guano. Already in 1854 they imported it almost to the same
amount as this country, and they had, moreover, sixty-two
manufactories of guano which supplied it to the amount of
sixteen times the imports. Compare also Ronna’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’agriculture
aux Etats Unis</cite>, 1881; Lecouteux, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le blé</cite>; and J. R. Dodge’s
<cite>Annual Report of the American Department of Agriculture</cite> for
1885 and 1886. Schaeffle’s work was also summed up in

different sorts of wheat, oats, and barley under trial. I think
that my friend, Dr. William Saunders, is quite right in saying
that this system of supplying a great number of farmers with

the yield of corn in Canada.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">Few books have exercised so pernicious an
influence upon the general development
of economic thought as Malthus’s <cite>Essay on the
Principle of Population</cite> exercised for three
consecutive generations. It appeared at the
right time, like all books which have had any
influence at all, and it summed up ideas already
current in the minds of the wealth-possessing
minority. It was precisely when the ideas of
equality and liberty, awakened by the French
and American revolutions, were still permeating
the minds of the poor, while the richer
classes had become tired of their amateur excursions
into the same domains, that Malthus
came to assert, in reply to Godwin, that no
equality is possible; that the poverty of the
many is not due to institutions, but is a natural
<em>law</em>. Population, he wrote, grows too rapidly
and the new-comers find no room at the feast of
nature; and that law cannot be altered by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
change of institutions. He thus gave to the
rich a kind of scientific argument against the
ideas of equality; and we know that though
all dominion is based upon force, force itself
begins to totter as soon as it is no longer supported
by a firm belief in its own rightfulness.
As to the poorer classes&mdash;who always feel the
influence of ideas circulating at a given time
amid the wealthier classes&mdash;it deprived them
of the very hope of improvement; it made
them sceptical as to the promises of the social
reformers; and to this day the most advanced
reformers entertain doubts as to the possibility
of satisfying the needs of all, in case
there should be a claim for their satisfaction,
and a temporary welfare of the labourers resulted
in a sudden increase of population.</p>

<p>Science, down to the present day, remains
permeated with Malthus’s teachings. Political
economy continues to base its reasoning upon a
tacit admission of the impossibility of rapidly
increasing the productive powers of a nation,
and of thus giving satisfaction to all wants.
This postulate stands, undiscussed, in the
background of whatever political economy,
classical or socialist, has to say about exchange-value,
wages, sale of labour force, rent, exchange,
and consumption. Political economy never
rises above the hypothesis of a <em>limited and insufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
supply of the necessaries of life</em>; it
takes it for granted. And all theories connected
with political economy retain the same
erroneous principle. Nearly all socialists, too,
admit the postulate. Nay, even in biology
(so deeply interwoven now with sociology) we
have recently seen the theory of variability of
species borrowing a quite unexpected support
from its having been connected by Darwin and
Wallace with Malthus’s fundamental idea, that
the natural resources must inevitably fail to
supply the means of existence for the rapidly
multiplying animals and plants. In short, we
may say that the theory of Malthus, by shaping
into a pseudo-scientific form the secret desires
of the wealth-possessing classes, became the
foundation of a whole system of practical
philosophy, which permeates the minds of both
the educated and uneducated, and reacts (as
practical philosophy always does) upon the
theoretical philosophy of our century.</p>

<p>True, the formidable growth of the productive
powers of man in the industrial field,
since he tamed steam and electricity, has somewhat
shaken Malthus’s doctrine. Industrial
wealth <em>has</em> grown at a rate which no possible
increase of population could attain, and it <em>can</em>
grow with still greater speed. But agriculture
is still considered a stronghold of the Mal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>thusian
pseudo-philosophy. The recent achievements
of agriculture and horticulture are not
sufficiently well known; and while our gardeners
defy climate and latitude, acclimatise
sub-tropical plants, raise several crops a year
instead of one, and themselves make the soil
they want for each special culture, the economists
nevertheless continue saying that the
surface of the soil is limited, and still more its
productive powers; they still maintain that
a population which should double each thirty
years would soon be confronted by a lack
of the necessaries of life!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few data to illustrate what <em>can</em> be obtained
from the soil were given in the preceding
chapter. But the deeper one goes into the
subject, the more new and striking data does he
discover, and the more Malthus’s fears appear
groundless.</p>

<p>To begin with an instance taken from culture
in the open field&mdash;namely, that of wheat&mdash;we
come upon the following interesting fact. While
we are so often told that wheat-growing does not
pay, and England consequently reduces from
year to year the area of its wheat fields, the
French peasants steadily increase the area
under wheat, and the greatest increase is due to
those peasant families which themselves cultivate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
the land they own. In the course of the nineteenth
century they have nearly doubled the
area under wheat, as well as the returns from
each acre, so as to increase almost fourfold the
amount of wheat grown in France.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>At the same time the population has only
increased by 41 per cent., so that the ratio of
increase of the wheat crop has been six times
greater than the ratio of increase of population,
although agriculture has been hampered all the
time by a series of serious obstacles&mdash;taxation,
military service, poverty of the peasantry, and
even, up to 1884, a severe prohibition of all
sorts of association among the peasants.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
must also be remarked that during the same
hundred years, and even within the last fifty
years, market-gardening, fruit-culture and culture
for industrial purposes have immensely
developed in France; so that there would be no
exaggeration in saying that the French obtain
now from their soil at least six or seven times
more than they obtained a hundred years ago.
The “means of existence” drawn from the soil
have thus grown about fifteen times quicker
than the population.</p>

<p>But the ratio of progress in agriculture is still
better seen from the rise of the standard of
requirement as regards cultivation of land.
Some thirty years ago the French considered a
crop very good when it yielded twenty-two
bushels to the acre; but with the same soil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the present requirement is at least thirty-three
bushels, while in the best soils the crop is good
only when it yields from forty-three to forty-eight
bushels, and occasionally the produce is
as much as fifty-five bushels to the acre.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
There are whole countries&mdash;Hesse, for example&mdash;which
are satisfied only when the <em>average</em>
crop attains thirty-seven bushels, or Denmark,
where the average crop (1908-1910) is forty-one
bushels per acre (forty-four bushels in 1910).<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
As to the experimental farms of Central France,
they produce from year to year, over large areas,
forty-one bushels to the acre; and a number
of farms in Northern France regularly yield,
year after year, from fifty-five to sixty-eight
bushels to the acre. Occasionally even so much
as eighty bushels have been obtained upon
limited areas under special care.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> In fact,
Prof. Grandeau considers it proved that by
combining a series of such operations as the
selection of seeds, sowing in rows, and proper
manuring, the crops can be largely increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
over the best present average, while the cost of
production can be reduced by 50 per cent. by
the use of inexpensive machinery; to say nothing
of costly machines, like the steam digger, or the
pulverisers which make the soil required for
each special culture. They are now occasionally
resorted to here and there, and they surely
will come into general use as soon as humanity
feels the need of largely increasing its agricultural
produce.</p>

<p>In fact, a considerable progress has already
been realised in French agriculture by labour-saving
machinery during the last twenty-five
years; but there still remains an immense field
for further improvement. Thus, in 1908, France
had already in use 25,000 harvesting machines
and 1,200 binders as against 180 only of the
former and sixty of the second, which were
used in 1882; but it is calculated that no less
than 375,000 more harvesting machines and
300,000 mowing machines are required to satisfy
the needs of French agriculture. The same must
be said as regards the use of artificial manure,
irrigation, pumping machinery, and so on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we bear in mind the very unfavourable
conditions in which agriculture stands now all
over the world, we must not expect to find
considerable progress in its methods realised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
over wide regions; we must be satisfied with
noting the advance accomplished in separate,
especially favoured spots, where, for one cause
or another, the tribute levied upon the agriculturist
has not been so heavy as to stop all
possibility of progress.</p>

<p>One such example may be seen in the district
of Saffelare in East Flanders. Thirty
years ago, on a territory of 37,000 acres, all
taken, a population of 30,000 inhabitants, all
peasants, not only used to find its food, but
managed, moreover, to keep no less than 10,720
horned cattle, 3,800 sheep, 1,815 horses and
6,550 swine, to grow flax, and to export various
agricultural produce.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> And during the last
thirty years it has continued steadily to increase
its exports of agricultural produce.</p>

<p>Another illustration of this sort may be
taken from the Channel Islands, whose inhabitants
have happily not known the blessings
of Roman law and landlordism, as they still live
under the common law of Normandy. The
small island of Jersey, eight miles long and less
than six miles wide, still remains a land of open-field
culture; but, although it comprises only
28,707 acres, rocks included, it nourishes a
population of about two inhabitants to each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
acre, or 1,300 inhabitants to the square mile,
and there is not one writer on agriculture who,
after having paid a visit to this island, did not
praise the well-being of the Jersey peasants
and the admirable results which they obtain in
their small farms of from five to twenty acres&mdash;very
often less than five acres&mdash;by means of a
rational and intensive culture.</p>

<p>Most of my readers will probably be astonished
to learn that the soil of Jersey, which
consists of decomposed granite, with no organic
matter in it, is not at all of astonishing fertility,
and that its climate, though more sunny
than the climate of these isles, offers many
drawbacks on account of the small amount of
sun-heat during the summer and of the cold
winds in spring. But so it is in reality, and
at the beginning of the nineteenth century the
inhabitants of Jersey lived chiefly on imported
food. (See <a href="#APP_L">Appendix L</a>.) The successes accomplished
lately in Jersey are entirely due to
the amount of labour which a dense population
is putting in the land; to a system of land-tenure,
land-transference and inheritance very
different from those which prevail elsewhere;
to freedom from State taxation; and to the
fact that communal institutions have been
maintained, down to quite a recent period, while
a number of communal habits and customs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
of mutual support, derived therefrom, are alive
to the present time. As to the fertility of the
soil, it is made partly by the sea-weeds gathered
free on the sea-coast, but chiefly by artificial
manure fabricated at Blaydon-on-Tyne, out of all
sorts of refuse&mdash;inclusive of bones shipped from
Plevna and mummies of cats shipped from Egypt.</p>

<p>It is well known that for the last thirty years
the Jersey peasants and farmers have been
growing early potatoes on a great scale, and
that in this line they have attained most satisfactory
results. Their chief aim being to have
the potatoes out as early as possible, when they
fetch at the Jersey Weigh-Bridge as much as
£17 and £20 the ton, the digging out of potatoes
begins, in the best sheltered places, as early as the
first days of May, or even at the end of April.
Quite a system of potato-culture, beginning
with the selection of tubers, the arrangements
for making them germinate, the selection of
properly sheltered and well situated plots of
ground, the choice of proper manure, and ending
with the box in which the potatoes germinate
and which has so many other useful applications,&mdash;quite
a system of culture has been worked
out in the island for that purpose by the collective
intelligence of the peasants.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span></p>

<p>In the last weeks of May and in June, when
the export is at its height, quite a fleet of
steamers runs between the small island of
Jersey and various ports of England and
Scotland. Every day eight to ten steamers
enter the harbour of St. Hélier, and in twenty-four
hours they are loaded with potatoes and
steer for London, Southampton, Liverpool,
Newcastle, and Scotland. From 50,000 to 60,000
tons of potatoes, valued at from £260,000 to
£500,000, according to the year, are thus exported
every summer; and, if the local consumption
be taken into account, we have at
least 60,000 to 70,000 tons that are obtained,
although no more than from 6,500 to 7,500
acres are given to all potato crops, early and
late&mdash;early potatoes, as is well known, never
giving as heavy crops as the later ones. Ten
to eleven tons per acre is thus the average,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
while in this country the average is only six
tons per acre.</p>

<p>As soon as the potatoes are out, the second
crop of mangold or of “three months’ wheat”
(a special variety of rapidly growing wheat)
is sown. Not one day is lost in putting it in.
The potato-field may consist of one or two
acres only, but as soon as one-fourth part of it
is cleared of the potatoes it is sown with the
second crop. One may thus see a small field
divided into four plots, three of which are
sown with wheat at five or six days’ distance
from each other, while on the fourth plot the
potatoes are being dug out.</p>

<p>The admirable condition of the meadows and
the grazing land in the Channel Islands has
often been described, and although the aggregate
area which is given in Jersey to green crops,
grasses under rotation, and permanent pasture&mdash;both
for hay and grazing&mdash;is less than 11,000
acres, they keep in Jersey over 12,300 head of
cattle and over 2,300 horses solely used for
agriculture and breeding.</p>

<p>Moreover, about 100 bulls and 1,600 cows and
heifers are exported every year,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> so that by this
time, as was remarked in an American paper,
there are more Jersey cows in America than
in Jersey Island. Jersey milk and butter have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
a wide renown, as also the pears which are
grown in the open air, but each of which is
protected on the tree by a separate cap, and
still more the fruit and vegetables which are
grown in the hothouses. In a word, it will
suffice to say that on the whole they obtain
agricultural produce to the value of £50 to
each acre of the aggregate surface of the island.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fifty pounds’ worth of agricultural produce
from each acre of the land is sufficiently good.
But the more we study the modern achievements
of agriculture, the more we see that the
limits of productivity of the soil are not attained,
even in Jersey. New horizons are continually
unveiled. For the last fifty years
science&mdash;especially chemistry&mdash;and mechanical
skill have been widening and extending the
industrial powers of man upon organic and
inorganic dead matter. Prodigies have been
achieved in that direction. Now comes the
turn of similar achievements with living plants.
Human skill in the treatment of living matter,
and science&mdash;in its branch dealing with living
organisms&mdash;step in with the intention of doing
for the art of food-growing what mechanical
and chemical skill have done in the art of
fashioning and shaping metals, wood and the
dead fibres of plants. Almost every year brings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
some new, often unexpected improvement in
the art of agriculture, which for so many
centuries had been dormant.</p>

<p>We just saw that while the average potato
crop in the country is six tons per acre, in Jersey
it is nearly twice as big. But Mr. Knight,
whose name is well known to every horticulturist
in this country, has once dug out of his fields
no less than 1,284 bushels of potatoes, or
thirty-four tons and nine cwts. in weight, on
one single acre; and at a recent competition in
Minnesota 1,120 bushels, or thirty tons, could
be ascertained as having been grown on one acre.</p>

<p>These are undoubtedly extraordinary crops,
but quite recently the French Professor Aimé
Girard undertook a series of experiments in
order to find out the best conditions for growing
potatoes in his country.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> He did not care
for show-crops obtained by means of extravagant
manuring, but carefully studied all conditions:
the best variety, the depth of tilling
and planting, the distance between the plants.
Then he entered into correspondence with some
350 growers in different parts of France, advised
them by letters, and finally induced them
to experiment. Strictly following his instructions,
several of his correspondents made experiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
on a small scale, and they obtained&mdash;instead
of the three tons which they were
accustomed to grow&mdash;such crops as would
correspond to twenty and thirty-six tons to the
acre. Moreover, ninety growers experimented
on fields more than one-quarter of an acre in
size, and more than twenty growers made their
experiments on larger areas of from three to
twenty-eight acres. The result was that <em>none
of them obtained less than twelve tons</em> to the acre,
while some obtained twenty tons, and the
average was, for the 110 growers, fourteen and
a half tons per acre.</p>

<p>However, industry requires still heavier crops.
Potatoes are largely used in Germany and
Belgium for distilleries; consequently, the distillery
owners try to obtain the greatest possible
amounts of starch from the acre. Extensive
experiments have lately been made for that
purpose in Germany, and the crops were: Nine
tons per acre for the poor sorts, fourteen tons
for the better ones, and thirty-two and four-tenths
tons for the best varieties of potatoes.</p>

<p>Three tons to the acre and more than thirty
tons to the acre are thus the ascertained limits;
and one necessarily asks oneself: Which of the
two requires <em>less labour</em> in tilling, planting, cultivating
and digging, and less expenditure in
manure&mdash;thirty tons grown on ten acres, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
same thirty tons grown on one acre or two? If
labour is of no consideration, while every penny
spent in seeds and manure is of great importance,
as is unhappily very often the case with the
peasant&mdash;he will perforce choose the first method.
But is it the most economic?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again, I just mentioned that in the Saffelare
district and Jersey they succeed in keeping one
head of horned cattle to each acre of green crops,
meadows and pasture land, while elsewhere two
or three acres are required for the same purpose.
But better results still can be obtained by means
of irrigation, either with sewage or even with
pure water. In England, farmers are contented
with one and a half and two tons of hay per acre,
and in the part of Flanders just mentioned,
two and a half tons of hay to the acre are considered
a fair crop. But on the irrigated fields of
the Vosges, the Vaucluse, etc., in France, six
tons of dry hay become the rule, even upon ungrateful
soil; and this means considerably more
than the annual food of one milch cow (which
can be taken at a little less than five tons)
grown on each acre. All taken, the results of
irrigation have proved so satisfactory in France
that during the years 1862-1882 no less than
1,355,000 acres of meadows have been irrigated,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
which means that the annual meat-food of at
least 1,500,000 full-grown persons, or more,
has been added to the yearly income of the
country; home-grown, not imported. In fact,
in the valley of the Seine, the value of the land
was doubled by irrigation; in the Saône valley
it was increased five times, and ten times in certain
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">landes</i> of Brittany.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The example of the Campine district, in Belgium,
is classical. It was a most unproductive
territory&mdash;mere sand from the sea, blown into
irregular mounds which were only kept together
by the roots of the heath; the acre of it used to
be sold, not rented, at from 5s. to 7s. (15 to 20
francs per hectare). But now it is capable,
thanks to the work of the Flemish peasants
and to irrigation, to produce the food of one
milch cow per acre&mdash;the dung of the cattle being
utilised for further improvements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span></p>

<p>The irrigated meadows round Milan are another
well-known example. Nearly 22,000 acres are
irrigated there with water derived from the sewers
of the city, and they yield crops of from eight
to ten tons of hay as a rule; occasionally some
separate meadows will yield the fabulous amount&mdash;fabulous
to-day, but no longer fabulous to-morrow&mdash;of
eighteen tons of hay per acre, that
is, the food of nearly four cows to the acre,
and nine times the yield of good meadows in this
country.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> However, English readers need not
go so far as Milan for ascertaining the results
of irrigation by sewer water. They have several
such examples in this country, in the experiments
of Sir John Lawes, and especially at Craigentinny,
near Edinburgh, where, to use Ronna’s words,
“the growth of rye grass is so activated that it
attains its full development in one year instead
of in three to four years. Sown in August, it
gives a first crop in autumn, and then, beginning
with next spring, a crop of four tons to the acre
is taken every month; which represents in the
fourteen months more than fifty-six tons (of
green fodder) to the acre.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> At Lodge Farm
they grow forty to fifty-two tons of green crops
per acre, after the cereals, without new manuring.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
At Aldershot they obtain excellent potato
crops; and at Romford (Breton’s Farm) Colonel
Hope obtained, in 1871-1872, quite extravagant
crops of various roots and potatoes.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>It can thus be said that while at the present
time we give two and three acres for keeping one
head of horned cattle, and only in a few places
one head of cattle is kept on each acre given to
green crops, meadows and pasture, man has
already in irrigation (which very soon repays
when it is properly made) the possibility of keeping
twice and even thrice as many head of cattle
to the acre over parts of his territory. Moreover,
the very heavy crops of roots which are now
obtained (seventy-five to 110 tons of beetroot to
the acre are not infrequent) give another powerful
means for increasing the number of cattle
without taking the land from what is now given
to the culture of cereals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another new departure in agriculture, which
is full of promises and probably will upset many
a current notion, must be mentioned in this
place. I mean the almost horticultural treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
of our corn crops, which is widely practised
in the far East, and begins to claim our attention
in Western Europe as well.</p>

<p>At the First International Exhibition, in 1851,
Major Hallett, of Manor House, Brighton, had a
series of very interesting exhibits which he described
as “pedigree cereals.” By picking out
the best plants of his fields, and by submitting
their descendants to a careful selection from year
to year, he had succeeded in producing new
prolific varieties of wheat and barley. Each
grain of these cereals, instead of giving only two
to four ears, as is the usual average in a corn-field,
gave ten to twenty-five ears, and the best
ears, instead of carrying from sixty to sixty-eight
grains, had an average of nearly twice that
number of grains.</p>

<p>In order to obtain such prolific varieties Major
Hallett naturally could not sow his picked grains
broadcast; he planted them, each separately,
in rows, at distances of from ten to twelve inches
from each other. In this way he found that
each grain, having full room for what is called
“tillering” (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tallage</i> in French<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>), would produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
ten, fifteen, twenty-five, and even up to ninety
and 100 ears, as the case may be; and as each
ear would contain from 60 to 120 grains, crops of
500 to 2,500 grains, or more, could be obtained
from each separately planted grain. He even
exhibited at the Exeter meeting of the British
Association three plants of wheat, barley, and
oats, each from a single grain, which had the
following number of stems: wheat, ninety-four
stems; barley, 110 stems; oats, eighty-seven
stems.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The barley plant which had 110 stems
thus gave something like 5,000 to 6,000 grains
from one single grain. A careful drawing of
that wonderful stubble was made by Major
Hallett’s daughter and circulated with his
pamphlets.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Again, in 1876, a wheat plant, with
“105 heads growing on one root, on which more
than 8,000 grains were growing at once,” was
exhibited at the Maidstone Farmers’ Club.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Two different processes were thus involved in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Hallett’s experiments: a process of selection, in
order to create new varieties of cereals, similar
to the breeding of new varieties of cattle; and
a method of immensely increasing the crop from
each grain and from a given area, by planting
each seed separately and wide apart, so as to
have room for the full development of the young
plant, which is usually suffocated by its neighbours
in our corn-fields.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The double character of Major Hallett’s
method&mdash;the breeding of <em>new prolific varieties</em>,
and the method of culture by <em>planting the seeds
wide apart</em>&mdash;seems, however, so far as I am entitled
to judge, to have been overlooked until
quite lately. The method was mostly judged
upon its results; and when a farmer had experimented
upon “Hallett’s Wheat,” and found
out that it was late in ripening in his own
locality, or gave a less perfect grain than some
other variety, he usually did not care more about
the method.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> However, Major Hallett’s successes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
or non-successes in breeding such or such
varieties are quite distinct from what is to be
said about the method itself of selection, or the
method of planting wheat seeds wide apart.
Varieties which were bred, and which I saw
grown still at Manor Farm, on the windy downs
of Brighton may be, or may not be, suitable to this
or that locality. Latest physiological researches
give such an importance to evaporation in the
bringing of cereals to maturity that where evaporation
is not so rapid as it is on the Brighton
Downs, other varieties must be resorted to and
bred on purpose.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> I should also suggest that
quite different wheats than the English ought to
be experimented upon for obtaining prolific varieties;
namely, the quickly-growing Norwegian
wheat, the Jersey “three months’ wheat,” or
even Yakutsk barley, which matures with an
astonishing rapidity. And now that horticulturists,
so experienced in “breeding” and
“crossing” as Vilmorin, Carter, Sherif, W.
Saunders in Canada and many others are, have
taken the matter in hand, we may feel sure that
future progress will be made. But breeding is
one thing; and the planting wide apart of seeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
of an appropriate variety of wheat is quite
another thing.</p>

<p>This last method was lately experimented upon
by M. Grandeau, Director of the Station Agronomique
de l’Est, and by M. Florimond Dessprèz
at the experimental station of Capelle; and in
both cases the results were most remarkable.
At this last station a method which is in use in
France for the choice of seeds was applied.
Already now some French farmers go over their
wheat fields before the crop begins, choose the
soundest plants which bear two or three equally
strong stems, adorned with long ears, well
stocked with grains, and take these ears. Then
they crop off with scissors the top and the bottom
of each ear and keep its middle part only, which
contains the biggest seeds. With a dozen quarts
of such selected grains they obtain next year
the required quantity of seeds of a superior
quality.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The same was done by M. Dessprèz. Then
each seed was planted separately, eight inches
apart in a row, by means of a specially devised
tool, similar to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rayonneur</i> which is used for
planting potatoes; and the rows, also eight
inches apart, were alternately given to the big
and to the smaller seeds. One-fourth part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
an acre having been planted in this way, with
seeds obtained from both early and late ears,
crops corresponding to 83·8 bushels per acre
for the first series, and 90·4 bushels for the
second series, were obtained; even the small
grains gave in this experiment as much as 70·2
and 62 bushels respectively.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The crop was thus more than doubled by the
choice of seeds and by planting them separately
eight inches apart. It corresponded in Dessprèz’s
experiments to <em>600 grains obtained on the average
from each grain sown</em>; and one-tenth or one-eleventh
part of an acre was sufficient in such
case to grow the eight and a half bushels of wheat
which are required on the average for the annual
bread food per head of a population which would
chiefly live on bread.</p>

<p>Prof. Grandeau, Director of the French Station
Agronomique de l’Est, has also made, since 1886,
experiments on Major Hallett’s method, and he
obtained similar results. “In a proper soil,” he
wrote, “one single grain of wheat can give as
much as fifty stems (and ears), and even more,
and thus cover a circle thirteen inches in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
diameter.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But as he seems to know how difficult
it often is to convince people of the plainest
facts, he published the photographs of separate
wheat plants grown in different soils, differently
manured, including pure river sand enriched by
manure.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> He concluded that under proper
treatment 2,000 and even 4,000 grains could be
easily obtained from each planted grain. The
seedlings, growing from grains planted ten inches
apart, cover the whole space, and the experimental
plot takes the aspect of an excellent
cornfield, as may be seen from a photograph
given by Grandeau in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Etudes
agronomiques</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Squares at Professor Grandeau’s experimental station, planted with grains of wheat,
in three different soils: <em>a</em>, pure sand; <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>, manured arable soil;
each grain 12 inches apart.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In fact, the eight and a half bushels required
for one man’s annual food were actually grown
at the Tomblaine station on a surface of 2,250<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
square feet, or forty-seven feet square&mdash;that
is, on very nearly one-twentieth part of an
acre.</p>

<p>Again, we may thus say, that where we require
now three acres, one acre would be sufficient for
growing the same amount of food, if planting
wide apart were resorted to. And there is,
surely, no more objection to planting wheat than
there is to sowing in rows, which is now in general
use, although at the time when the system was
first introduced, <em>in lieu</em> of the formerly usual
mode of sowing broadcast, it certainly was met
with great distrust. While the Chinese and the
Japanese used for centuries to sow wheat in
rows, by means of a bamboo tube adapted to the
plough, European writers objected, of course, to
this method under the pretext that it would require
too much labour. It is the same now with
planting each seed apart. Professional writers
sneer at it, although all the rice that is grown in
Japan is planted <em>and even replanted</em>. Everyone,
however, who will think of the labour which
must be spent for ploughing, harrowing, fencing,
and keeping free of weeds three acres instead of
one, and who will calculate the corresponding
expenditure in manure, will surely admit that
all advantages are in favour of the one acre as
against the three acres, to say nothing of the
possibilities of irrigation, or of the planting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
machine-tool, which will be devised as soon as
there is a demand for it.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>More than that, there is full reason to believe
that even this method is liable to further improvement
by means of <em>replanting</em>. Cereals in
such cases would be treated as vegetables are
treated in horticulture. Such is, at least, the
idea which began to germinate since the methods
of cereal culture that are resorted to in China
and Japan became better known in Europe.
(See <a href="#APP_O">Appendix O</a>.)</p>

<p>The future&mdash;a near future, I hope&mdash;will show
what practical importance such a method of
treating cereals may have. But we need not
speculate about that future. We have already,
in the facts mentioned in this chapter, an experimental
basis for quite a number of means of
improving our present methods of culture and of
largely increasing the crops. It is evident that in
a book which is not intended to be a manual of
agriculture, all I can do is to give only a few hints
to set people thinking for themselves upon this
subject. But the little that has been said is
sufficient to show that we have no right to complain
of over-population, and no need to fear it
in the future. Our means of obtaining from the
soil whatever we want, under <em>any</em> climate and
upon <em>any</em> soil, have lately been improved at such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
a rate that we cannot foresee yet what is the
limit of productivity of a few acres of land.
The limit vanishes in proportion to our better
study of the subject, and every year makes it
vanish further and further from our sight.</p>

<p>The wheat crop has thus increased in seventy-five years by 74
per cent., while the population increased only by 20 per cent.
For potatoes, the increase is still greater: while 198,800,000 cwt.
of potatoes were grown in 1882, the crop of 1909 was already
328,300,000 cwt., the average yield of the acre growing from

<p><a id="Footnote_81" href="#FNanchor_81" class="label">[81]</a> The increase of the crops due to irrigation is most instructive.
In the most unproductive Sologne, irrigation has
increased the hay crop from two tons per hectare (two and a half
acres) to eight tons; in the Vendée, from four tons of bad hay
to ten tons of excellent hay. In the Ain, M. Puris, having spent
19,000 francs for irrigating ninety-two and a half hectares
(about £2 10s. per acre), obtained an increase of 207 tons of
excellent hay. In the south of France, a net increase of over
four bushels of wheat per acre is easily obtained by irrigation;
while for market gardening the increase was found to attain
£30 to £40 per acre. (See H. Sagnier, “Irrigation,” in Barral’s
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire d’Agriculture</cite>, vol. iii., p. 339.) I hardly need
mention the striking results obtained lately by irrigation in
Egypt and on the dry plateaus of the United States.</p>

<p>Extension of market-gardening and fruit growing: in France;
in the United States&mdash;Culture under glass&mdash;Kitchen gardens
under glass&mdash;Hothouse culture: in Guernsey and
Jersey: in Belgium&mdash;Conclusion.</p>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">One of the most interesting features of the
present evolution of agriculture is the extension
lately taken by intensive market-gardening
of the same sort as has been described in the
third chapter. What formerly was limited to a
few hundreds of small gardens, is now spreading
with an astonishing rapidity. In this country
the area given to market-gardens, after having
more than doubled within the years 1879 to 1894,
when it attained 88,210 acres, has continued
steadily to increase.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> But it is especially in
France, Belgium, and America that this branch
of culture has lately taken a great development.
(See <a href="#APP_P">Appendix P</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span></p>

<p>At the present time no less than 1,075,000 acres
are given in France to market-gardening and
intensive fruit culture, and a few years ago it
was estimated that the <em>average</em> yield of every
acre given to these cultures attains £33, 10s.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Their character, as well as the amount of skill
displayed in, and labour given to, these cultures,
will best appear from the following illustrations.</p>

<p>About Roscoff, which is a great centre in
Brittany for the export to England of such potatoes
as will keep till late in summer, and of all
sorts of vegetables, a territory, twenty-six miles
in diameter, is entirely given to these cultures,
and the rents attain and exceed £5 per acre.
Nearly 300 steamers call at Roscoff to ship
potatoes, onions and other vegetables to London
and different English ports, as far north as Newcastle.
Moreover, as much as 4,000 tons of
vegetables are sent every year to Paris.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> And
although the Roscoff peninsula enjoys a specially
warm climate, small stone walls are erected everywhere,
and rushes are grown on their tops in
order to give still more protection and heat to
the vegetables.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The climate is improved as
well as the soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span></p>

<p>In the neighbourhoods of Cherbourg it is
upon land conquered from the sea that the best
vegetables are grown&mdash;more than 800 acres of that
land being given to potatoes exported to London;
another 500 acres are given to cauliflower; 125
acres to Brussels sprouts; and so on. Potatoes
grown under glass are also sent to the London
market from the middle of April, and the total
export of vegetables from Cherbourg to England
attains 300,000 cwts., while from the small port
of Barfleur another 100,000 cwts. are sent to this
country, and about 60,000 cwts. to Paris. Nay,
in a quite small commune, Surtainville, near Cherbourg,
£2,800 are made out of 180 acres of market-gardens,
three crops being taken every year:
cabbage in February, early potatoes next, and
various crops in the autumn&mdash;to say nothing of
the catch crops.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn-190" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'At Ploustagel'">
At Plougastel</ins> one hardly believes that he is
in Brittany. Melons used to be grown at that
spot, long since, in the open fields, with glass
frames to protect them from the spring frost,
and green peas were grown under the protection
of rows of furze which sheltered them from the
northern winds. Now, whole fields are covered
with strawberries, roses, violets, cherries and
plums, down to the very sea beach.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Even the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">landes</i> are reclaimed, and we are told that in five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
years or so there will be no more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">landes</i> in that
district (p. 265). Nay, the marshes of the Dol&mdash;“The
Holland of Brittany”&mdash;protected from the
sea by a wall (5,050 acres), have been turned
into market-gardens, covered with cauliflowers,
onions, radishes, haricot beans and so on, the
acre of that land being rented at from £2, 10s.
to £4.</p>

<p>The neighbourhoods of Nantes could also be
mentioned. Green peas are cultivated there on
a very large scale. During the months of May
and June quite an army of working people,
especially women and children, are picking
them. The roads leading to the great preserving
factories are covered at certain hours with rows
of carts, upon which the peas and onions are
carted one way, while another row of carts are
carrying the empty pods which are used for
manure. For two months the children are
missing in the schools; and in the peasant
families of the neighbourhood, when the question
comes about some expenditure to be made, the
usual saying is, “Wait till the season of the
green peas has come.”</p>

<p>About Paris no less than 50,000 acres are given
to the field culture of vegetables and 25,000 acres
to the forced culture of the same. Sixty years
ago the yearly rent paid by market-gardeners
attained already as much as £18 and £24 per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
acre, and yet it has been increased since, as well
as the gross receipts, which were valued by
Courtois Gérard at £240 per acre for the larger
market-gardeners, and twice as much for the
smaller ones in which early vegetables are grown
in frames.</p>

<p>The fruit culture in the neighbourhoods of
Paris is equally wonderful. At Montreuil, for
instance, 750 acres, belonging to 400 gardeners,
are literally covered with stone walls,
specially erected for growing fruit, and having
an aggregate length of 400 miles. Upon these
walls, peach trees, pear trees and vines are
spread, and every year something like 12,000,000
peaches are gathered, as well as a considerable
amount of the finest pears and grapes. The
acre in such conditions brings in £56. This is
how a “warmer climate” was made, at a
time when the greenhouse was still a costly
luxury. All taken, 1,250 acres are given to
peaches (25,000,000 peaches every year) in the
close neighbourhood of Paris. Acres and acres
are also covered with pear trees which yield
three to five tons of fruit per acre, such crop
being sold at from £50 to £60. Nay, at Angers,
on the Loire, where pears are eight days in
advance of the suburbs of Paris, Baltet knows
an orchard of five acres, covered with pears
(pyramid trees), which brings in £400 every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
year; and at a distance of thirty-three miles
from Paris one pear plantation brings in £24
per acre&mdash;the cost of package, transport and
selling being deducted. Likewise, the plantations
of plums, of which 80,000 cwts. are consumed
every year at Paris alone, give an annual
money income of from £29 to £48 per acre every
year; and yet, pears, plums and cherries are
sold at Paris, fresh and juicy, at such a price
that the poor, too, can eat fresh home-grown
fruit.</p>

<p>In the province of Anjou one may see how
a heavy clay, improved with sand taken from
the Loire and with manure, has been turned,
in the neighbourhoods of Angers, and especially
at Saint Laud, into a soil which is rented at
from £2, 10s. to £5 the acre, and upon that
soil fruit is grown which a few years ago was
exported to America.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> At Bennecour, a quite
small village of 850 inhabitants, near Paris,
one sees what man can make out of the most
unproductive soil. Quite recently the steep
slopes of its hills were only <em>mergers</em> from which
stone was extracted for the pavements of Paris.
Now these slopes are entirely covered with
apricot and cherry trees, black-currant shrubs,
and plantations of asparagus, green peas and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
the like. In 1881, £5,600 worth of apricots
alone was sold out of this village, and it must
be borne in mind that competition is so acute
in the neighbourhoods of Paris that a delay of
twenty-four hours in the sending of apricots
to the market will often mean a loss of 8s.&mdash;one-seventh
of the sale price on each hundred-weight.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>At Perpignan, green artichokes&mdash;a favourite
vegetable in France&mdash;are grown, from October
till June, on an area covering 2,500 acres, and
the net revenue is estimated at £32 per acre.
In Central France, artichokes are even cultivated
in the open fields, and nevertheless the crops
are valued (by Baltet) at from £48 to £100 per
acre. In the Loiret, 1,500 gardeners, who
occasionally employ 5,000 workmen, obtain
from £400,000 to £480,000 worth of vegetables,
and their yearly expenditure for manure is
£60,000. This figure alone is the best answer
to those who are fond of talking about the
extraordinary fertility of the soil, each time they
are told of some success in agriculture. At
Lyons, a population of 430,000 inhabitants is
entirely supplied with vegetables by the local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
gardeners. The same is in Amiens, which is
another big industrial city. The districts surrounding
Orléans form another great centre for
market-gardening, and it is especially worthy
of notice that the shrubberies of Orléans supply
even America with large quantities of young
trees.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>It would take, however, a volume to describe
the chief centres of market-gardening and
fruit-growing in France; and I will mention only
one region more, where vegetables and fruit-growing
go hand in hand. It lies on the banks
of the Rhône, about Vienne, where we find a
narrow strip of land, partly composed of granite
rocks, which has now become a garden of an
incredible richness. The origin of that wealth,
we are told by Ardouin Dumazet, dates from
some thirty years ago, when the vineyards,
ravaged by phylloxera, had to be destroyed
and some new culture had to be found. The
village of Ampuis became then renowned for
its apricots. At the present time, for a full
100 miles along the Rhône, and in the lateral
valleys of the Ardèche and the Drôme, the
country is an admirable orchard, from which
millions’ worth of fruit is exported, and the
land attains the selling price of from £325 to
£400 the acre. Small plots of land are continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
reclaimed for culture upon every
crag. On both sides of the roads one sees the
plantations of apricot and cherry trees, while
between the rows of trees early beans and peas,
strawberries, and all sorts of early vegetables
are grown. In the spring the fine perfume of
the apricot trees in bloom floats over the whole
valley. Strawberries, cherries, apricots, peaches
and grapes follow each other in rapid succession,
and at the same time cartloads of French beans,
salads, cabbages, leeks, and potatoes are sent
towards the industrial cities of the region. It
would be impossible to estimate the quantity
and value of all that is grown in that region.
Suffice it to say that a tiny commune, Saint
Désirat, exported during Ardouin Dumazet’s
visit about 2,000 cwts. of cherries every day.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The results of this development are simply
striking. Thus it appears, from an inquest
made in 1906 by the French professors of
agriculture, that the yearly export of fresh
flowers from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">département</i> of the Alpes Maritimes
attains as much as £400,000, and that
of the flowers used for perfumes gives from
£280,000 to £320,000 in addition to the just
mentioned sum.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> From the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">département</i> of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
Var, 3,475 tons of flowers, valued from £160,000
to £200,000, were exported in 1902.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I must refer the reader to the work of Charles
Baltet if he will know more about the extension
taken by market-gardening in different
countries, and will only mention Belgium and
America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The exports of vegetables from Belgium have
increased twofold within the last twenty years
of the nineteenth century, and whole regions,
like Flanders, claim to be now the market-garden
of England, even seeds of the vegetables
preferred in this country being distributed
free by one horticultural society in
order to increase the export. Not only the best
lands are appropriated for that purpose, but
even the sand deserts of the Ardennes and peat-bogs
are turned into rich market-gardens, while
large plains (namely at Haeren) are irrigated
for the same purpose. Scores of schools, experimental
farms, and small experimental
stations, evening lectures, and so on, are
opened by the communes, the private societies,
and the State, in order to promote horticulture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
and hundreds of acres of land are covered with
thousands of greenhouses.</p>

<p>Here we see one small commune exporting
5,500 tons of potatoes and £4,000 worth of pears
to Stratford and Scotland, and keeping for that
purpose its own line of steamers. Another
commune supplies the north of France and the
Rhenish provinces with strawberries, and occasionally
sends some of them to Covent Garden
as well. Elsewhere early carrots, which are
grown amidst flax, barley and white poppies,
give a considerable addition to the farmer’s
income. In another place we learn that land
is rented at £24 and £27 the acre, not for
grapes or melon-growing but for the modest
culture of onions; or that the gardeners have
done away with such a nuisance as natural soil in
their frames, and prefer to make their loam out
of wood sawings, tannery refuse and hemp dust,
“animalised” by various composts.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>In short, Belgium, which is one of the chief
manufacturing countries of Europe, is now
becoming one of the chief centres of horticulture.
(See <a href="#APP_R">Appendix R</a>.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other country which must especially be
recommended to the attention of horticulturists
is America. When we see the mountains of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
fruit imported from America we are inclined to
think that fruit in that country grows by itself.
“Beautiful climate,” “virgin soil,” “immeasurable
spaces”&mdash;these words continually recur in the
papers. The reality, however, is that horticulture&mdash;that
is, both market-gardening and fruit
culture&mdash;has been brought in America to a high
degree of perfection. Prof. Baltet, a practical
gardener himself, originally from the classical
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marais</i> (market-gardens) of Troyes, describes
the “truck farms” of Norfolk in Virginia as
real “model farms.” A highly complimentary
appreciation from the lips of a practical <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîcher</i>
who has learned from his infancy that only
in fairyland do the golden apples grow by the
fairies’ magic wand. As to the perfection to
which apple-growing has been brought in Canada,
the aid which the apple-growers receive from
the Canadian experimental farms, and the
means which are resorted to, on a truly American
scale, to spread information amongst the farmers
and to supply them with new varieties of fruit
trees&mdash;all this ought to be carefully studied in
this country, instead of inducing Englishmen
to believe that the American supremacy is due
to the golden fairies’ hands. If one tenth part of
what is done in the States and in Canada for
favouring agriculture and horticulture were
done in this country, English fruit would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
have been so shamefully driven out of the
market as it was a few years ago.</p>

<p>The extension given to horticulture in America
is immense. The “truck farms” alone&mdash;that
is, the farms which work for export by rail or
steam&mdash;covered in the States in 1892 no less
than 400,000 acres. At the very doors of
Chicago one single market-gardening farm
covers 500 acres, and out of these, 150 acres
are given to cucumbers, 50 acres to early peas,
and so on. During the Chicago Exhibition a
special “strawberry express,” composed of
thirty waggons, brought in every day 324,000
quarts of the freshly gathered fruit, and there
are days that over 10,000 bushels of strawberries
are imported in New York&mdash;three-fourths
of that amount coming from the “truck farms”
of Virginia by steamer.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>This is what can be achieved by an intelligent
combination of agriculture with industry, and
undoubtedly will be applied on a still larger
scale in the future.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>However, a further advance is being made in
order to emancipate horticulture from climate.
I mean the glasshouse culture of fruit and
vegetables.</p>

<p>Formerly the greenhouse was the luxury of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the rich mansion. It was kept at a high temperature,
and was made use of for growing,
under cold skies, the golden fruit and the bewitching
flowers of the South. Now, and
especially since the progress of technics allows
of making cheap glass and of having all the
woodwork, sashes and bars of a greenhouse
made by machinery, the glasshouse becomes
appropriated for growing fruit for the million,
as well as for the culture of common vegetables.
The aristocratic hothouse, stocked with the
rarest fruit trees and flowers, remains; nay,
it spreads more and more for growing luxuries
which become more and more accessible to
the great number. But by its side we
have the plebeian greenhouse, which is heated
for only a couple of months in winter and the
still more economically built “cool greenhouse,”
which is a simple glass shelter&mdash;a big
“cool frame”&mdash;and is stuffed with the humble
vegetables of the kitchen garden: the potatoes,
the carrots, the French beans, the peas and the
like. The heat of the sun, passing through the
glass, but prevented by the same glass from
escaping by radiation, is sufficient to keep it
at a very high temperature during spring and
early summer. A new system of horticulture&mdash;the
market-garden under glass&mdash;is thus rapidly
gaining ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span></p>

<p>The greenhouse for commercial purposes is
essentially of British, or perhaps Scottish,
origin. Already in 1851, Mr. Th. Rivers had
published a book, <cite>The Orchard Houses and the
Cultivation of Fruit Trees in Pots under Glass</cite>;
and we were told by Mr. D. Thomson, in the
<cite>Journal of Horticulture</cite> (31st January, 1889),
that nearly fifty years ago grapes in February
were sold at 25s. the pound by a grower in the
north of England, and that part of them was
sent by the buyer to Paris for Napoleon III.’s
table, at 50s. the pound. “Now,” Mr. Thomson
added, “they are sold at the tenth or twentieth
part of the above prices. Cheap coal&mdash;cheap
grapes; that is the whole secret.”</p>

<p>Large vineries and immense establishments
for growing flowers under glass are of an old
standing in this country, and new ones are
continually built on a grand scale. Entire
fields are covered with glass at Cheshunt, at
Broxburn (fifty acres), at Finchley, at Bexley,
at Swanley, at Whetstone, and so on, to say
nothing of Scotland. Worthing is also a well-known
centre for growing grapes and tomatoes;
while the greenhouses given to flowers and
ferns at Upper Edmonton, at Chelsea, at
Orpington, and so on, have a world-wide reputation.
And the tendency is, on the one side, to
bring grape culture to the highest degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
perfection, and, on the other side, to cover
acres and acres with glass for growing tomatoes,
French beans and peas, which undoubtedly
will soon be followed by the culture of still
plainer vegetables. This movement, as will be
seen further on, has been steadily continuing
for the last twenty years.</p>

<p>However, the Channel Islands and Belgium
still hold the lead in the development of glasshouse
culture. The glory of Jersey is, of
course, Mr. Bashford’s establishment. When
I visited it in 1890, it contained 490,000 square
feet under glass&mdash;that is, nearly thirteen acres&mdash;but
seven more acres under glass have been
added to it since. A long row of glasshouses,
interspersed with high chimneys, covers the
ground&mdash;the largest of the houses being 900 feet
long and forty-six feet wide; this means that
about one acre of land, in one piece, is under
glass. The whole is built most substantially;
granite walls, great height, thick “twenty-seven
oz. glass” (of the thickness of three
pennies),<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> ventilators which open upon a length
of 200 and 300 feet by working one single handle;
and so on. And yet the most luxurious of these
greenhouses was said by the owners to have
cost less than 1s. the square foot of glass (13d.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
the square foot of ground), while the other
houses have cost much less than that. From
5d. to 9d. the square foot of glass<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> is the
habitual cost, without the heating apparatus&mdash;6d.
being a current price for the ordinary
glasshouses.</p>

<p>But it would be hardly possible to give an
idea of all that is grown in such glasshouses,
without producing photographs of their insides.
In 1890, on the 3rd of May, exquisite grapes
began to be cut in Mr. Bashford’s vineries, and
the crop was continued till October. In other
houses, cartloads of peas had already been
gathered, and tomatoes were going to take
their place after a thorough cleaning of the
house. The 20,000 tomato plants, which were
going to be planted, had to yield no less than
eighty tons of excellent fruit (eight to ten pounds
per plant). In other houses melons were grown
instead of the tomatoes. Thirty tons of early
potatoes, six tons of early peas, and two tons
of early French beans had already been sent
away in April. As to the vineries, they yielded
no less than twenty-five tons of grapes every
year. Besides, very many other things were
grown in the open air, or as catch crops, and all
that amount of fruit and vegetables was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
result of the labour of thirty-six men and boys
only, under the supervision of one single gardener&mdash;the
owner himself; true that in Jersey,
and especially in Guernsey, everyone is a
gardener. About 1,000 tons of coke were burnt
to heat these houses. Mr. W. Bear, who had
visited the same establishment in 1886, was
quite right to say that from these thirteen acres
they obtained money returns equivalent to
what a farmer would obtain from 1,300 acres of
land.</p>

<p>I hardly need say that Mr. Rider Haggard,
who visited Jersey and Guernsey in 1901, gave
of these two islands the same enthusiastic description
as his predecessors. “I can only
state in conclusion,” he wrote, “that for my
part, here (in Jersey) as in Guernsey, I was
amazed at the prosperity of the place. That
so small an area of land can produce so much
wealth is nothing short of astonishing. It is
true, as I have shown, that the inquirer hears
some grumblings and fears for the future; but
when on the top of them he sees a little patch
of twenty-three and one-third acres of land,
such as I have instanced, and is informed
that quite recently it sold at an auction for
£5,760, to be used, not for building sites but for
the cultivation of potatoes, he is perhaps justified
in drawing his own conclusions.” It need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
not be added that, like all his predecessors,
Mr. Haggard disposes of the legend of extraordinary
natural fertility of the soil, and shows
at what a considerable expenditure the heavy
crops of potatoes are obtained.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>However, it is in the small “vineries” that
one sees, perhaps, the most admirable results.
As I walked through such glass-roofed kitchen
gardens, I could not but admire this recent
conquest of man. I saw, for instance, three-fourths
of an acre heated for the first three
months of the year, from which about eight
tons of tomatoes and about 200 lb. of French
beans had been taken as a first crop in April,
to be followed by two crops more. In these
houses one gardener was employed with two
assistants, a small amount of coke was consumed,
and there was a gas engine for watering purposes,
consuming only 13s. worth of gas during
the quarter. I saw again, in cool greenhouses&mdash;simple
plank and glass shelters&mdash;pea plants
covering the walls, for the length of one quarter
of a mile, which already had yielded by the end
of April 3,200 lb. of exquisite peas and were
yet as full of pods as if not one had been taken
off.</p>

<p>I saw potatoes dug from the soil in a cool
greenhouse, in April, to the amount of five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
bushels to the twenty-one feet square. And
when chance brought me, in 1896, in company
with a local gardener, to a tiny, retired “vinery”
of a veteran grower, I could see there, and admire,
what a lover of gardening can obtain from so
small a space as the two-thirds of an acre. Two
small “houses” about forty feet long and twelve
feet wide, and a third&mdash;formerly a pigsty, twenty
feet by twelve&mdash;contained vine trees which many
a professional gardener would be happy to have
a look at; especially the whilom pigsty, fitted
with “Muscats”! Some grapes (in June) were
already in full beauty, and one fully understands
that the owner could get in 1895, from a local
dealer, £4 for three bunches of grapes (one of
them was a “Colmar,” 13¾ lb. weight). The
tomatoes and strawberries in the open air, as
well as the fruit trees, all on tiny spaces, were
equal to the grapes; and when one is shown
on what a space half a ton of strawberries can
be gathered under proper culture, it is hardly
believable.</p>

<p>It is especially in Guernsey that the simplification
of the greenhouse must be studied. Every
house in the suburbs of St. Peter has some sort
of greenhouse, big or small. All over the island,
especially in the north, wherever you look, you
see greenhouses. They rise amid the fields and
from behind the trees; they are piled upon one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
another on the steep crags facing the harbour
of St. Peter; and with them a whole generation
of practical gardeners has grown up. Every
farmer is more or less of a gardener, and he gives
free scope to his inventive powers for devising
some cheap type of greenhouses. Some of them
have almost no front and back walls&mdash;the glass
roofs coming low down and the two or three feet
of glass in front simply reaching the ground; in
some houses the lower sheet of glass was simply
plunged into a wooden trough standing on the
ground and filled with sand. Many houses have
only two or three planks, laid horizontally, instead
of the usual stone wall, in the front of the
greenhouse.</p>

<p>The large houses of one big company are built
close to each other, and have no partitions
between. But this system cannot be recommended.
Altogether, when I revisited Guernsey
in 1903, I saw that the system of greenhouses
which prevailed was that of long two-roofed
glass “tents,” placed by the side of each other,
but separated from each other by partitions
preventing the circulation of the air over the
whole block. As to the extensive <em>cool</em> greenhouses
on the Grande Maison estate, which are
built by a company and are rented to gardeners
for so much the 100 feet, they are simply made
of thin deal board and glass. They are on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
“lean to” or “one roof” system, and the back
wall, ten feet high, and the two side walls are
in simple grooved boards, standing upright. The
whole is supported by uprights inserted into
concrete pillars. They are said to cost not more
than 5d. the square foot, of glass-covered ground.
And yet, even such plain and cheap houses yield
excellent results. The potato crop which had been
grown in some of them was excellent, as also the
green peas.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>In Jersey I even saw a row of five houses, the
walls of which were made of corrugated iron, for
the sake of cheapness. Of course, the owner
himself was not over-sanguine about his houses.
“They are too cold in winter and too hot in
summer.” But although the five houses cover
only less than one-fifth of an acre, 2,000 lb. of
green peas had already been sold as a first crop;
and, in the first days of June, the second crop
(about 1,500 plants of tomatoes) was already in
good progress.</p>

<p>It is always difficult, of course, to know what
are the money returns of the growers, first of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
because Thorold Rogers’ complaint about modern
farmers keeping no accounts holds good,
even for the best gardening establishments, and
next because when the returns are known to me
in all details, it would not be right for me to
publish them. “Don’t prove too much; beware
of the landlord!” a practical gardener once
wrote to me. Roughly speaking, I can only
confirm Mr. Bear’s estimate to the effect that
under proper management even a cool greenhouse,
which covers 4,050 square feet, can give
a gross return of £180.</p>

<p>As a rule, the Guernsey and Jersey growers
have only three crops every year from their
greenhouses. They will start, for instance,
potatoes in December. The house will, of course,
not be heated, fires being made only when a
sharp frost is expected at night; and the potato
crop (from eight to ten tons per acre) will be
ready in April or May before the open-air potatoes
begin to be dug out. Tomatoes will be planted
next and be ready by the end of the summer.
Various catch crops of peas, radishes, lettuce and
other small things will be taken in the meantime.
Or else the house will be “started” in November
with melons, which will be ready in April. They
will be followed by tomatoes, either in pots, or
trained as vines, and the last crop of tomatoes
will be in October. Beans may follow and be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
ready for Christmas. I need not say that every
grower has his preference method for utilising
his houses, and it entirely depends upon his skill
and watchfulness to have all sorts of small catch
crops. These last begin to have a greater and
greater importance, and one can already foresee
that the growers under glass will be forced to
accept the methods of the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîchers</i>,
so as to have five and six crops every year, so far
as it can be done without spoiling the present
high quality of the produce.</p>

<p>All this industry is of a relatively recent origin.
One may see it still working out its methods.
And yet the exports from Guernsey alone are
already represented by quite extraordinary
figures. It was estimated some years ago that
they were as follows: Grapes, 502 tons, £37,500
worth at the average price of 9d. the pound;
tomatoes, 1,000 tons, about £30,000; early
potatoes (chiefly in the fields), £20,000; radishes
and broccoli, £9,250; cut flowers, £3,000;
mushrooms, £200; total, £99,950&mdash;to which
total the local consumption in the houses and
hotels, which have to feed nearly 30,000 tourists,
must be added. Since then these figures have
grown considerably. In June, 1896, I saw the
Southampton steamers taking every day from
9,000 to 12,000, and occasionally more, baskets
of fruit (grapes, tomatoes, French beans and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
peas), each basket representing from twelve to
fourteen pounds of fruit. Taking into account
what was sent by other channels, one could say
that from 400 to 500 tons of tomatoes, grapes,
beans and peas, worth from £20,000 to £25,000,
were exported there every week in June.</p>

<p>When I returned to Guernsey in 1903, I found
that the industry of fruit-growing under glass
had grown immensely since 1896, so that the
whole system of export had to be reorganised.
In 1896 it was the tourists’ boats which transported
the fruit and vegetables to Southampton,
and the gardeners paid one shilling for each
basket taken at Guernsey and delivered at the
Covent Garden market. In 1903 there was
already a Guernsey Growers’ Association, which
had its own boats keeping, during the summer,
a regular daily service direct from Guernsey to
London. The Association had its own storehouses
on the quay and its own cranes, which
lifted immense cubic boxes containing on their
shelves twenty or even a hundred baskets, and
carrying them to the boats. The cost of transport
was thus reduced to 4d. per basket. All this
crop is sold every morning at Covent Garden to
the London dealers and greengrocers. The importance
of this export is seen from the fact
that a special steamer has to leave Guernsey
every morning with its cargo of fruit and vege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>tables.
As to the total exports of fresh flowers,
plants and shrubs, various fruit and vegetables
(including £555,275 worth of potatoes), they
reached £1,115,650 in 1910.</p>

<p>All this is obtained from an island whose
total area, rocks and barren hill-tops included,
is only 16,000 acres, of which only 9,884 acres
are under culture, and 5,189 acres are given to
green crops and meadows. An island, moreover,
on which 1,480 horses, 7,260 head of cattle
and 900 sheep find their existence. How many
men’s food is, then, grown on these 10,000
acres?</p>

<p>Belgium has also made, within the last few
years, an immense progress in the same direction.
While no more than 250 acres, all taken,
were covered with glass some thirty years ago,
more than 800 acres are under glass by this
time.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> In the village of Hoeilaert, which is
perched upon a stony hill, nearly 200 acres are
under glass, given up to grape-growing. One
single establishment, Baltet remarks, has 200
greenhouses and consumes 1,500 tons of coal for
the vineries.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> “Cheap coal&mdash;cheap grapes,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
as the editor of the <cite>Journal of Horticulture</cite> wrote.
Grapes in Brussels are certainly not dearer in
the beginning of the summer than they are in
Switzerland in October. Even <em>in March</em>, Belgian
grapes were sold in Covent Garden at from
4d. and 6d. the pound.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> This price alone shows
sufficiently how small are the amounts of labour
which are required to grow grapes in our latitudes
with the aid of glass. <em>It certainly costs less
labour to grow grapes in Belgium than to grow
them on the coasts of Lake Leman.</em><a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>I will not conclude this chapter without
casting a glance on the progress that has been
made in this country since the first edition of this
book was published, in 1898, by fruit and flower
farming, as also by culture under glass, and on
the attempts recently made to introduce in
different parts of England “French Gardening,”&mdash;that
is, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culture maraîchère</i> of the French
gardeners.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest doubt that fruit-growing
has notably increased&mdash;the area under
fruit orchards having grown in Great Britain
from 200,000 acres in 1888 to 250,000 acres in
1908; while the area under small fruit (gooseberries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
currants, strawberries) has grown from
75,000 acres in 1901 to 85,000 in 1908.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> In
fact, in some counties the acreage has trebled.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Large plantations of fruit have grown lately
round London and all the large cities, and the
counties of Kent, Devon, Hereford, Somerset,
Worcester and Gloucester have now more
than 20,000 acres each under fruit orchards,
a great proportion of them being of a recent
origin. Not only was the area of fruit-growing
considerably increased, but, owing to the experiments
carried on since 1894 at the Woburn
Experimental Farm, where different sorts of
fruit-trees and small fruit are tested, new varieties
have been introduced; and the system is
spreading of growing fruit trees of the pyramidal
or “bush” form (instead of the old-fashioned
standards)&mdash;a step the advantages of which I
was enabled fully to appreciate in 1897 at the
Agassiz Experimental Farm in British Columbia.</p>

<p>At the same time the culture of small fruit&mdash;gooseberries,
raspberries, currants, and especially
strawberries&mdash;took an immense development.
Enormous quantities of strawberries are now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
grown in Mid and South Kent, where we find the
culture of fruit combined with large jam factories.
One of such factories is connected with great
fruit farms covering 2,000 acres at Swanley, and
its yearly output attains 3,500 tons of jam,
850 tons of candied peel, and more than 100,000
bottles of bottled fruit. An extensive horticulture
has also developed of late in Cambridgeshire,
wherefrom fruit is sent partly fresh to
London and Manchester, and partly is transformed
on the spot in the jam factory at Histon.
No less than 250 workpeople were employed at
this factory at the time of Rider Haggard’s visit
in 1900, and no less than 7,600 tons were exported;
the most interesting result of this industry
combined with agriculture being that
quite a number of small farmers, renting from
three to twenty acres each, have grown round the
jam factory. “Altogether,” Mr. Haggard wrote,
“fruit and flower culture has increased enormously;
so that, in 1901, from 4,000 to 5,000
acres in the neighbourhood of Wisbech were
devoted to this trade. Plums, apples, pears,
small fruit, as also cauliflowers, asparagus,
rhubarb, narcissi, pansies and other flowers
were grown here on a grand scale, and as much
as from 130 to 140 tons of gooseberries and from
60 to 70 tons of strawberries were despatched
from Wisbech in one single day.” “The result of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
this industry,” Mr. Haggard adds, “was that the
population of Wisbech and the number of houses
in this little town have rapidly increased;
the land has increased in value considerably in
the past twenty years, and as much as £200 an
acre had been given for choice land-holdings
suitable for fruit culture.” (<cite>Rural England</cite>,
vol. ii., pp. 52, 54, 55.) In other words, the net
result of the labour spent by the farmers and of
the intelligent enterprise of the industrials was,
as everywhere, immensely to increase the value
of the land for the benefit of the landlords.
Mr. Haggard’s conclusion is worth mentioning,
as he writes as follows: “Broadly, however,
I may say that where the farms are large and
corn is chiefly grown, there is little or no prosperity,
while where they are small and assisted
by pastures or fruit culture, both owners and
tenants are doing fairly well.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> A recognition
well worth mentioning, as it comes from an
explorer who took at the outset of his inquest
a most pessimistic view on unprotected agriculture.</p>

<p>I also ought to mention Essex, where fruit-growing
has taken of late a notable development,
and Hampshire, where the acreage under
fruit has trebled since 1880, according to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
testimony of the author of the already mentioned
<cite>Britannica</cite> article. The same must be said of
Worcestershire, and especially of the Evesham
district. This last is a most instructive region.
Owing to certain peculiarities of its soil, which
render it very profitable for growing asparagus
and plum trees, and partly owing to the maintenance
in this region of the old “Evesham
custom” (according to which from times immemorial
the ingoing tenant had to pay the outgoing
tenant, not the landlord, for the agricultural
improvements)&mdash;a custom maintained till nowadays<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>&mdash;the
small-holdings system and the culture
of vegetables and fruit have developed to a
remarkable extent. The result is that out of a
rural area of 10,000 acres, 7,000 have already
been taken in small holdings of under fifty acres
each, and the demand for them, far from being
satisfied, is still on the increase, so that in
1911 there were still nearly four hundred farmers
waiting for 2,000 acres. A new town has grown
at Evesham, its population of 8,340 persons being
almost entirely composed of gardeners and gardeners’
labourers; its markets, held twice a
week, remind one of markets in the south of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
France; and the export traffic on the railways
radiating from that little town is as lively as
if it were a busy industrial spot.</p>

<p>One cannot read the pages given by Mr.
Rider Haggard to the Bewdley and Evesham
districts without being impressed by what can
be obtained from the soil in England, and by
what has to be done by the nation and all those
who care for its well-being in obtaining from the
soil what it is ready to give, if only <em>labour</em> be
applied to it.</p>

<p>In the Bewdley district we see very well
how the efforts of a Small Holdings Society are
giving the opportunity to a number of small
farmers to transform an indifferent and sometimes
very poor or stony land into a fertile soil
which yields rich crops of fruit, and upon which
the keeping of milch-cows is combined with
fruit-growing. We see also how in the big farms,
as well as in the small ones, fruit-growing is
carried on with knowledge and care&mdash;and,
consequently, with a substantial profit for both
the community and the farmers&mdash;which makes
the author exclaim: “How different in most
counties! In Norfolk, for instance (and I may
add in Devonshire), the ordinary farm orchard
is stocked as a rule with faggot-headed trees
pruned only by the wind. Even the dead wood
is left uncut; yet it is common to hear farmers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
complain of the quality of the fruit, and that it
will not pay to grow” (vol. i., p. 338).</p>

<p>Speaking of Catshill, Mr. Haggard gives also
a very interesting instance of how a colony of
people called “Nailers,” who lived formerly by
making nails by hand, and compelled to abandon
this trade when machine-made nails were introduced,
took to agriculture, and how they succeed
with it. Some intelligent people having bought
a farm of 140 acres and divided it into small
farms, from 2½ to 8 acres, these small holdings
were offered to the nailers; and at the
time of Mr. Haggard’s visit “every instalment
which was due had been paid up.” No able-bodied
man out of them has gone on to the
rates.</p>

<p>But the vale of Evesham is still more interesting.
Suffice it to say, that while in most
rural parishes the population is decreasing, <em>it
rose in the six parishes of the Evesham Union</em>
from 7,327 to 9,012 in the ten years, 1891 to
1901.</p>

<p>Although the soil of this district offers nothing
extraordinary, and the conditions of sale are as bad
as anywhere, owing to the importance acquired
by the middlemen, we see that an extremely
important industry of fruit-growing has developed;
so important that in the year 1900 about
20,000 tons of fruit and vegetables were sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
from the Evesham stations, in addition to large
quantities exported from the small stations
within a radius of ten miles round Evesham
(vol. i., p. 350). The soil, of course, is improved
by digging into it large quantities of all sorts
of manure&mdash;soot, fish guano, leather dust for
cabbage (chamois dust being the best), and so
on&mdash;and the most profitable sorts of fruit-trees
and vegetables are continually tested; all this
being, of course, not the work of some scientist
or of one single man, but the product of the
collective experience of the district.</p>

<p>It must not be thought, however, that fruit-growing
has been overdone. On the contrary,
the imports of fruit into the United Kingdom,
both for food and for jam-making, continue
to be enormous, and to increase every year.
Suffice it to say, that this country imports every
year about £1,000,000 of tomatoes and £2,000,000
of apples, half a million worth of pears, nearly
£730,000 worth of grapes&mdash;giving thus a total
of £4,200,000 worth of all fruit. And at the same
time we learn that immense quantities of land
go every year out of culture, to be transformed
into game reserves for rich Englishmen and
foreigners.</p>

<p>Finally, I also ought to mention the recent
development of fruit culture near the Broads
of Norfolk, and especially in Ireland; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
examples just given will do to show what is
obtained from the land in England where no
obstacle is laid to the development of horticulture,
and what amount of food can be obtained
in the climate and from the soil of this
country whenever it is properly cultivated.
Let me only add that a similar development of
fruit culture has taken place within the last
thirty years everywhere in the civilised countries;
and that in France, in Belgium, and in
Germany the extension taken by horticulture
during the last twenty or thirty years has been
much greater than in this country.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>As regards <em>market-gardening</em>, it has undoubtedly
made remarkable progress in the
United Kingdom within recent years. However,
accurate data are failing, and those who
have travelled over this country with the special
purpose of studying its agriculture have not
yet given sufficient attention to the recent
developments of market-gardening; but it is
quite certain that within the last five-and-twenty
years it has taken a great development,
especially in Ireland, but also in several parts
of England, Scotland, and Wales.</p>

<p>Such are, for instance, the neighbourhoods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
of Penzance, in Cornwall; those of St. Neots,
in Huntingdonshire; Scotter, in Lincolnshire,
where the agricultural depression&mdash;we are told
by Mr. Rider Haggard&mdash;was not so badly felt
as elsewhere on account of market-gardening;
Benington, in the same county, where the soil
is a rich loam with silty subsoil, and where all
sorts of vegetables, potatoes, and flower-bulbs
are grown on a large scale, together with wheat.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Orpington is a well-known centre for market-gardening,
as well as for fruit-growing, and
in this district culture under glass has also
taken lately some extension.</p>

<p>There are many other interesting centres of
market-gardening, especially in the neighbourhoods
of all large cities, but I will mention only
one more&mdash;namely, Potton, in Huntingdonshire.
It is&mdash;we are told by Mr. Haggard&mdash;“a
stronghold of small cultivators who grow
vegetables upon holdings of land varying in
size from one up to twenty acres, or even more.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
It has thus become an important centre for
market-gardening, “120 trucks of produce
leaving Potton daily during the season for
London, in addition to fifty trucks which pass
over the Great Northern line from Sandy station,
together with much more from sidings and other
stations.” This is the more interesting as
within a short distance from this animated
centre “thousands of acres are quite or very
nearly derelict, and the farmhouses, buildings,
and cottages are slowly rotting down.” The
worst is that “all this land was cultivated, and
grew crops up to the ’eighties.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Another oasis of market-gardening is offered
by the county of Bedfordshire. “Being a
county of natural small-holdings, carved out
before the passing of the 1907 Act,” it is rapidly
becoming&mdash;we are told by Mr. F. E. Green&mdash;“a
county of market-gardens.” The fertility
of its soil, the fact that it can easily be worked
at any time of the year, and that a race of
skilled gardeners has developed there long
since, have contributed to that growth; but,
of course, the whole is hampered by the heavy
rents, which have grown up to £4 an acre for
the sites near the station, where manure is
received in large quantities from London.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
Happily enough, the Bedfordshire County Council
has been eager to acquire land for small
holdings, and, after having spent £40,000 in the
acquisition of land, they have, up to 30th June,
1911, provided one-third of the applicants with
2,759 acres&mdash;the total demand, by a thousand
applicants, having already attained 12,350 acres.</p>

<p>And yet all this progress still appears insignificant
by the side of the demand for vegetables
which grows every year (and necessarily
<em>must</em> grow, as is seen by comparing the low consumption
of vegetables in this country with
the consumption of home-grown vegetables in
Belgium, indicated by Mr. Rowntree in his
<cite>Lessons from Belgium</cite>). The result is a steadily
increasing importation of vegetables to this
country, which has attained now more than
£8,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span></p>

<p>A branch of horticulture which has increased
enormously since the first edition of this book
was published, is the <em>growing of fruit and vegetables
in greenhouses</em>, in the same way as it is
done in the Channel Islands. All round London&mdash;we
are told by Mr. John Weathers in the last
edition of the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>&mdash;the
hothouse culture has taken a great development,
and, in fact, along the railways which
radiate from London in all directions the
glass-houses have already become a familiar
feature of the landscape. Immense quantities
of grapes, tomatoes, figs, and of all sorts of
early vegetables are grown at Worthing, where
eighty-two acres are covered now with glass-houses,
as also in the parish of Cheshunt, in
Herts, where the area under hothouses is already
130 acres; while a careful estimate put in 1908
the area of individual hothouses in England
at about 1,200 acres (<cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>,
vol. xi., p. 266). The elements of this culture
having been developed by the experience of
the Channel Islands growers, and by the wide
extension which hothouses for the growing of
flowers had taken long since in this country,
it may be concluded from the various evidence
we have at hand that on the whole this sort
of culture is finding its reward, and is now
firmly established.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span></p>

<p>The same, however, cannot yet be said of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culture maraîchère</i> of the French market-gardeners
which is being introduced now into
this country. Many attempts have been made
in this direction in different parts of the country
with varied degrees of success; but little or
nothing is known about the results. An attempt
on a large scale was made, as is known,
by some Evesham gardeners. Having read
about this sort of culture in France, and the
wonderful results obtained by it, some of the
Evesham gardeners went to Paris with the
intention of learning that culture from the
Paris <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîchers</i>. Finding that impossible, they
invited a French gardener to Evesham, gave
him three-quarters of an acre, and, after he had
brought from his Paris <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marais</i> his glass-bells,
frames and lights, and, above all, his knowledge,
he began gardening under the eyes of
his Evesham colleagues. “Happily enough,” he
said to an interviewer, “I do not speak English;
otherwise I should have had to talk all the time
and give explanations, instead of working.
So I show them my black trousers, and tell
them in signs: ‘Begin by making the soil as
black as these trousers, then everything will
be all right.’” Of course, to be profitable,
immense quantities of stable manure are required,
as also immense numbers of glass-bells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
and glass-frames, which represent a very
costly outlay, and plenty of watering, to say
nothing of the powers of observation required
for developing a new branch of gardening in
new surroundings.</p>

<p>What were the results obtained at Evesham
it is difficult to say, the more so as the money
results which, according to some papers, were
obtained the first year (<em>brutto</em> income of £750
from three-quarters of an acre) seem to have
been exaggerated for a first-year crop, and thus
awakened scepticism with regard to that sort
of culture altogether.</p>

<p>Another experiment in the same direction was
made on the estate of Mayland, in Essex, which
was bought by Mr. Joseph Fels in order to
promote small farming in England. It must
be said that, apart from the cold, damp climate
of this part of England, the heavy clay of Essex
represents the least appropriate soil for spade
culture. In England, as everywhere, this sort
of culture has always been developing in preference
<em>on a light loam</em>, or in such places, like
Jersey, where a meagre granitic soil could
easily be manured&mdash;in this special case by sea-weeds.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the aim of Mr. Fels having been
chiefly educational, this aim has certainly been
achieved, as we have now, in three different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
works of Mr. Thomas Smith, the manager of
the farm, practical manuals teaching the
would-be gardener the essentials of “French
Gardening.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>A French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîcher</i> having been invited
for this purpose, and 2,500 glass-bells, 1,000
lights for frames, a windmill pump, etc., having
been bought at a considerable cost, the work
of the French gardener on two acres of land
was carefully followed by the manager of the
farm, Mr. T. Smith, day by day, to be afterwards
described and illustrated by photographs for
the use of those who would like to try their
hand at the same work.</p>

<p>Most of my readers will probably ask first of
all: What were the money results of this venture?
But it would have been foolish to expect
that in this first experiment everything should
have run as smoothly as it runs, let us say, in
the Channel Islands, where the many years’
practice of a whole population has worked out
the best methods of culture.</p>

<p>Thus the frames were not ready in time
for giving an early crop of melons; and although
the melons grown at Mayland were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
excellent, and gave the first year as much as
£188, they would have given much more than
that had they been ready in the middle of
June, which would have been possible if the
frames and lights had been supplied in time.</p>

<p>With all that, the results obtained during the
first year were really striking. All taken, Mr.
Smith shows that if the gardener has a one-acre
garden, and if £494 (say, £550) be spent
for 1,000 glass-bells, 300 lights and 100 frames,
500 mats, the water-supply, the packing-shed,
the fencing, the cart, horse and harness,
etc., and £413 (say, £450) for 500 tons of
manure, the rent, rates and water, and the
wages and salaries (£250), the gross returns
for the first year would reach £300 (making
full allowance for “inexperience in this <em>special</em>
work”). They would reach from £400 to £450
during the second year, there being greater
productiveness and a lower expenditure after
the loam has been <em>made</em> by heavy manuring,
and personal experience has been won, as well
as experience for a given locality.</p>

<p>Taking a one-acre farm, of which only one-third
is used for a French garden, the first
year’s expenditure for bells, lights, fencing, horse
manure, water, and rent and taxes would
be a little less than £300, and the returns by
the end of the first year would be about £150.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
“Afterwards the returns ought to reach from
£200 to £250 each year,” Mr. Smith writes.</p>

<p>All that need be added to these words is, that
Mr. Smith is extremely cautious in his estimates,
and that, seeing the high crops obtained
at Mayland, and fully dealt with in Mr. Smith’s
works, one is entitled to expect even better
money results.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after having worked at the
farm for one year, the experienced French
gardener, who had obtained the just-mentioned
results, left Mayland. Two young French
gardeners, far less experienced, were invited
instead, and they began to undo what their
predecessor had done, in order to carry on the
work on the lines they had learned themselves.
So that it is impossible to know yet what the
results of these new methods will be.</p>

<p>Every pioneer work has its unforeseen difficulties.
But, so far as can be judged from
the facts I have at my disposal, the two ventures
have proved that the climate of England
is no obstacle to French gardening. Of course,
the small amount of sunshine is a great obstacle
for ripening the produce as early as it can be
ripened in France, even in the suburbs of Paris.
But home-grown fruit and vegetables have
always many advantages in comparison with
imported produce. Another disadvantage&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
lack of horse manure&mdash;a disadvantage which
will go on increasing with the spread of
motor cars&mdash;is felt in France as well. This is
why the French growers are eagerly experimenting
with the direct heating of the soil
with <em>thermosiphons</em>.</p>

<p>Let me add to these remarks that a decided
awakening is to be noticed in this country for
making a better use of the land than has been
made for the last fifty years. There are a few
counties where the County Councils, and still
more so, the Parish Councils, are doing their
best to break at last the land monopoly, and to
permit those small farmers who intend to
cultivate the soil to do so. Here and there
we see a few timid attempts at imparting to
the farmers and their children some knowledge
of agriculture and horticulture. But all this
is being made on too small a scale, and without
a sincere desire to learn from other European
nations, and still more so from the United
States and Canada, what is being done in
these countries to give to agriculture the new
character of intensive culture combined with
industry, which is imposed upon it by the
recent progress of civilisation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The various data which have been brought
together on the preceding pages make short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
work of the over-population fallacy. It is precisely
in the most densely populated parts of
the world that agriculture has lately made such
strides as hardly could have been guessed twenty
years ago. A dense population, a high development
of industry, and a high development of
agriculture and horticulture, go hand in hand:
they are inseparable. As to the future, the
possibilities of agriculture are such that, in
truth, we cannot yet foretell what would be the
limit of the population which could live from
the produce of a given area. Recent progress,
already tested on a great scale, has widened
the limits of agricultural production to a quite
unforeseen extent; and recent discoveries,
now tested on a small scale, promise to widen
those limits still farther, to a quite unknown
degree.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The present tendency of economical development
in the world is&mdash;we have seen&mdash;to induce
more and more every nation, or rather every
region, taken in its geographical sense, to rely
chiefly upon a home production of all the chief
necessaries of life. Not to reduce, I mean,
the world-exchange: it may still grow in bulk;
but to limit it to the exchange of what really
<em>must</em> be exchanged, and, at the same time,
immensely to increase the exchange of novelties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
produce of local or national art, new
discoveries and inventions, knowledge and
ideas. Such being the tendency of present
development, there is not the slightest ground
to be alarmed by it. There is not one nation in
the world which, being armed with the present
powers of agriculture, could not grow on its
cultivable area all the food and most of the
raw materials derived from agriculture which
are required for its population, even if the
requirements of that population were rapidly
increased as they certainly ought to be. Taking
the powers of man over the land and over the
forces of nature&mdash;<em>such as they are at the present
day</em>&mdash;we can maintain that two to three inhabitants
to each cultivable acre of land would
not yet be too much. But neither in this
densely populated country nor in Belgium are
we yet in such numbers. In this country we
have, roughly speaking, one acre of the cultivable
area per inhabitant.</p>

<p>Supposing, then, that each inhabitant of
Great Britain were compelled to live on the
produce of his own land, all he would have to
do would be, first, to consider the land of this
country as a common inheritance, which must
be disposed of to the best advantage of each
and all&mdash;this is, evidently, an absolutely necessary
condition. And next, he would have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
cultivate his soil, not in some extravagant way,
but no better than land is already cultivated
upon thousands and thousands of acres in
Europe and America. He would not be bound
to invent some new methods, but could simply
generalise and widely apply those which have
stood the test of experience. He can do it;
and in so doing he would save an immense
quantity of the work which is now given for
buying his food abroad, and for paying all the
intermediaries who live upon this trade. Under
a rational culture, those necessaries and those
luxuries which must be obtained from the
soil, undoubtedly <em>can</em> be obtained with much
less work than is required now for buying these
commodities. I have made elsewhere (in <cite>The
Conquest of Bread</cite>) approximate calculations to
that effect, but with the data given in this
book everyone can himself easily test the truth
of this assertion. If we take, indeed, the
masses of produce which are obtained under
rational culture, and compare them with the
amount of labour which must be spent for
obtaining them under an irrational culture, for
collecting them abroad, for transporting them,
and for keeping armies of middlemen, we see
at once how few days and hours need be given,
under proper culture, for growing man’s food.</p>

<p>For improving our methods of culture to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
that extent, we surely need not divide the land
into one-acre plots, and attempt to grow what
we are in need of by everyone’s separate individual
exertions, on everyone’s separate plot
with no better tools than the spade; under
such conditions we inevitably should fail. Those
who have been so much struck with the wonderful
results obtained in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite culture</i>,
that they go about representing the small
culture of the French peasant, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîcher</i>, as
an ideal for mankind, are evidently mistaken.
They are as much mistaken as those other
extremists who would like to turn every country
into a small number of huge Bonanza farms,
worked by militarily organised “labour battalions.”
In Bonanza farms human labour is
certainly reduced, but the crops taken from
the soil are far too small, and the whole system
is robbery-culture, taking no heed of the exhaustion
of the soil. This is why the Bonanza
farms have disappeared from their former
home, Ohio; and when I crossed part of this
State in 1901 I saw its plains thickly dotted with
medium-sized farms, from 100 to 200 acres,
and with windmills pumping water for the
orchards and the vegetable gardens. On the
other side, in the spade culture, on isolated
small plots, by isolated men or families, too
much human labour is wasted, even though the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
crops are heavy; so that real economy&mdash;of both
space and labour&mdash;requires different methods,
representing a combination of machinery work
with hand work.</p>

<p>In agriculture, as in everything else, associated
labour is the only reasonable solution.
Two hundred families of five persons each,
owning five acres per family, having no common
ties between the families, and compelled to find
their living, each family on its five acres, almost
certainly would be an economical failure. Even
leaving aside all <em>personal</em> difficulties resulting
from different education and tastes and from
the want of knowledge as to what has to be
done with the land, and admitting for the
sake of argument that these causes do not interfere,
the experiment would end in a failure,
merely for <em>economical</em>, for <em>agricultural</em> reasons.
Whatever improvement upon the present conditions
such an organisation might be, that
improvement would not last; it would have
to undergo a further transformation or disappear.</p>

<p>But the same two hundred families, if they
consider themselves, say, as tenants of the
nation, and treat the thousand acres as a
common tenancy&mdash;again leaving aside the
<em>personal</em> conditions&mdash;would have, economically
speaking, from the point of view of the agri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>culturist,
every chance of succeeding, <em>if they
know what is the best use to make of that land</em>.</p>

<p>In such case they probably would first of all
associate for permanently improving the land
which is in need of immediate improvement, and
would consider it necessary to improve more
of it every year, until they had brought it all
into a perfect condition. On an area of 340
acres they could most easily grow all the cereals&mdash;wheat,
oats, etc.&mdash;required for both the
thousand inhabitants and their live stock,
without resorting for that purpose to replanted
or planted cereals. They could grow on 400
acres, properly cultivated, and irrigated if necessary
and possible, all the green crops and fodder
required to keep the thirty to forty milch cows
which would supply them with milk and butter,
and, let us say, the 300 head of cattle required
to supply them with meat. On twenty acres,
two of which would be under glass, they would
grow more vegetables, fruit and luxuries than
they could consume. And supposing that half
an acre of land is attached to each house for
hobbies and amusement (poultry keeping, or
any fancy culture, flowers, and the like)&mdash;they
would still have some 140 acres for all
sorts of purposes: public gardens, squares,
manufactures and so on. The labour that
would be required for such an intensive culture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
would not be the hard labour of the serf or
slave. It would be accessible to everyone,
strong or weak, town bred or country born;
it would also have many charms besides. And
its total amount would be far smaller than the
amount of labour which every thousand persons,
taken from this or from any other nation, have
now to spend in getting their present food,
much smaller in quantity and of worse quality.
I mean, of course, the technically necessary
labour, without even considering the labour
which we now have to give in order to maintain
all our middlemen, armies, and the like. The
amount of labour required to grow food under
a rational culture is so small, indeed, that our
hypothetical inhabitants would be led necessarily
to employ their leisure in manufacturing,
artistic, scientific, and other pursuits.</p>

<p>From the technical point of view there is no
obstacle whatever for such an organisation being
started to-morrow with full success. The obstacles
against it are not in the imperfection
of the agricultural art, or in the infertility of
the soil, or in climate. They are entirely in
our institutions, in our inheritances and survivals
from the past&mdash;in the “Ghosts” which
oppress us. But to some extent they lie also&mdash;taking
society as a whole&mdash;in our phenomenal
ignorance. We, civilised men and women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
know everything, we have settled opinions upon
everything, we take an interest in everything.
We only know nothing about whence the bread
comes which we eat&mdash;even though we pretend
to know something about that subject as well&mdash;we
do not know how it is grown, what pains
it costs to those who grow it, what is being
done to reduce their pains, what sort of men
those feeders of our grand selves are ... we
are more ignorant than savages in this respect,
and we prevent our children from obtaining
this sort of knowledge&mdash;even those of our
children who would prefer it to the heaps of
useless stuff with which they are crammed at
school.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-capy">The two sister arts of agriculture and industry
were not always so estranged from
one another as they are now. There was a time,
and that time is not so far back, when both
were thoroughly combined; the villages were
then the seats of a variety of industries, and the
artisans in the cities did not abandon agriculture;
many towns were nothing else but industrial
villages. If the mediæval city was the
cradle of those industries which bordered upon
art and were intended to supply the wants of the
richer classes, still it was the rural manufacture
which supplied the wants of the million, as it
does until the present day in Russia, and to a
very great extent in Germany and France.
But then came the water-motors, steam, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
development of machinery, and they broke the
link which formerly connected the farm with the
workshop. Factories grew up and they abandoned
the fields. They gathered where the sale
of their produce was easiest, or the raw materials
and fuel could be obtained with the greatest
advantage. New cities rose, and the old ones
rapidly enlarged; the fields were deserted.
Millions of labourers, driven away by sheer force
from the land, gathered in the cities in search of
labour, and soon forgot the bonds which formerly
attached them to the soil. And we, in our admiration
of the prodigies achieved under the
new factory system, overlooked the advantages
of the old system under which the tiller of the
soil was an industrial worker at the same time.
We doomed to disappearance all those branches
of industry which formerly used to prosper in
the villages; we condemned in industry all that
was not a big factory.</p>

<p>True, the results were grand as regards the
increase of the productive powers of man. But
they proved terrible as regards the millions of
human beings who were plunged into misery
and had to rely upon precarious means of living
in our cities. Moreover, the system, as a whole,
brought about those abnormal conditions which
I have endeavoured to sketch in the two first
chapters. We were thus driven into a corner;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
and while a thorough change in the present
relations between labour and capital is becoming
an imperious necessity, a thorough remodelling
of the whole of our industrial organisation has also
become unavoidable. The industrial nations are
bound to revert to agriculture, they are compelled
to find out the best means of combining it
with industry, and they must do so without loss
of time.</p>

<p>To examine the special question as to the
possibility of such a combination is the aim of the
following pages. Is it possible, from a technical
point of view? Is it desirable? Are there, in
our present industrial life, such features as might
lead us to presume that a change in the above
direction would find the necessary elements for
its accomplishment? Such are the questions
which rise before the mind. And to answer them,
there is, I suppose, no better means than to study
that immense but overlooked and underrated
branch of industries which are described under
the names of rural industries, domestic trades,
and petty trades: to study them, not in the
works of the economists who are too much
inclined to consider them as obsolete types
of industry, but in their life itself, in their
struggles, their failures and achievements.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The variety of forms of organisation which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
found in the small industries is hardly suspected
by those who have not made them a subject of
special study. There are, first, two broad categories:
those industries which are carried on in
the villages, in connection with agriculture; and
those which are carried on in towns or in villages,
with no connection with the land&mdash;the workers
depending for their earnings exclusively upon
their industrial work.</p>

<p>In Russia, in France, in Germany, in Austria,
and so on, millions and millions of workers are in
the first case. They are owners or occupiers of
the land, they keep one or two cows, very often
horses, and they cultivate their fields, or their
orchards, or gardens, considering industrial
work as a by-occupation. In those regions,
especially, where the winter is long and no work
on the land is possible for several months every
year, this form of small industries is widely
spread. In this country, on the contrary, we find
the opposite extreme. Few small industries
have survived in England in connection with
land-culture; but hundreds of petty trades are
found in the suburbs and the slums of the great
cities, and large portions of the populations of
several towns, such as Sheffield and Birmingham,
find their living in a variety of petty trades.
Between these two extremes there is evidently a
mass of intermediate forms, according to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
more or less close ties which continue to exist
with the land. Large villages, and even towns,
are thus peopled with workers who are engaged
in small trades, but most of whom have a small
garden, or an orchard, or a field, or only retain
some rights of pasture on the commons, while
part of them live exclusively upon their industrial
earnings.</p>

<p>With regard to the sale of the produce, the
small industries offer the same variety of organisation.
Here again there are two great branches.
In one of them the worker sells his produce
directly to the wholesale dealer; cabinet-makers,
weavers, and workers in the toy trade are in
this case. In the other great division the worker
works for a “master” who either sells the
produce to a wholesale dealer, or simply acts as
a middleman who himself receives his orders
from some big concern. This is the “sweating
system,” properly speaking, under which we find
a mass of small trades. Part of the toy trade,
the tailors who work for large clothing establishments&mdash;very
often for those of the State&mdash;the
women who sew and embroider the “uppers”
for the boot and shoe factories, and who as often
deal with the factory as with an intermediary
“sweater,” and so on, are in this case. All
possible gradations of feudalisation and sub-feudalisation
of labour are evidently found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
that organisation of the sale of the produce.</p>

<p>Again, when the industrial, or rather technical
aspects of the small industries are considered,
the same variety of types is soon discovered.
Here also there are two great branches: those
trades, on the one side, which are purely domestic&mdash;that
is, those which are carried on in the house
of the worker, with the aid of his family, or of
a couple of wage-workers; and those which are
carried on in separate workshops&mdash;all the just-mentioned
varieties, as regards connection with
land and the divers modes of disposing of the
produce, being met with in both these branches.
All possible trades&mdash;weaving, workers in wood,
in metals, in bone, in india-rubber, and so on&mdash;may
be found under the category of purely
domestic trades, with all possible gradations
between the purely domestic form of production
and the workshop and the factory.</p>

<p>Thus, by the side of the trades which are
carried on entirely at home by one or more
members of the family, there are the trades in
which the master keeps a small workshop attached
to his house and works in it with his
family, or with a few “assistants”&mdash;that is, wage-workers.
Or else the artisan has a separate
workshop, supplied with wheel-power, as is the
case with the Sheffield cutlers. Or several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
workers come together in a small factory which
they maintain themselves, or hire in association,
or where they are allowed to work for a certain
weekly rent. And in each of these cases they
work either directly for the dealer or for a small
master, or for a middleman.</p>

<p>A further development of this system is the
big factory, especially of ready-made clothes, in
which hundreds of women pay so much for the
sewing-machine, the gas, the gas-heated irons,
and so on, and are paid themselves so much for
each piece of the ready-made clothes they sew,
or each part of it. Immense factories of this
kind exist in England, and it appeared from
testimony given before the “Sweating Committee”
that women are fearfully “sweated”
in such workshops&mdash;the full price of each slightly
spoiled piece of clothing being deducted from
their very low piecework wages.</p>

<p>And, finally, there is the small workshop
(often with hired wheel-power) in which a master
employs three to ten workers, who are paid in
wages, and sells his produce to a bigger employer
or merchant&mdash;there being all possible gradations
between such a workshop and the small factory
in which a few time workers (five, ten to twenty)
are employed by an independent producer. In
the textile trades, weaving is often done either
by the family or by a master who employs one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
boy only, or several weavers, and after having
received the yarn from a big employer, pays a
skilled workman to put the yarn in the loom,
invents what is necessary for weaving a given,
sometimes very complicated pattern, and after
having woven the cloth or the ribbons in his
own loom or in a loom which he hires himself, he
is paid for the piece of cloth according to a very
complicated scale of wages agreed to between
masters and workers. This last form, we shall
see presently, is widely spread up to the present
day, especially in the woollen and silk trades;
it continues to exist by the side of big factories
in which 50, 100, or 5,000 wage-workers, as the
case may be, are working with the employers’
machinery and are paid in time-wages so much
the day or the week.</p>

<p>The small industries are thus quite a world,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
which, remarkable enough, continues to exist
even in the most industrial countries, side by
side with the big factories. Into this world we
must now penetrate to cast a glimpse upon it:
a glimpse only, because it would take volumes
to describe its infinite variety of pursuits and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
organisation, and its infinitely varied connection,
with agriculture as well as with other industries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Most of the petty trades, except some of those
which are connected with agriculture, are, we
must admit, in a very precarious position. The
earnings are very low, and the employment is
often uncertain. The day of labour is by two,
three, or four hours longer than it is in well-organised
factories, and at certain seasons it
reaches an almost incredible length. The crises
are frequent and last for years. Altogether, the
worker is much more at the mercy of the dealer
or the employer, and the employer is at the mercy
of the wholesale dealer. Both are liable to
become enslaved to the latter, running into debt
to him. In some of the petty trades, especially
in the fabrication of the plain textiles, the workers
are in dreadful misery. But those who pretend
that such misery is the rule are totally wrong.
Anyone who has lived among, let us say, the
watch-makers in Switzerland and knows their
inner family life, will recognise that the condition
of these workers was out of all comparison
superior, in every respect, material and moral,
to the conditions of millions of factory hands.
Even during such a crisis in the watch trade as
was lived through in 1876-1880, their condition
was preferable to the condition of factory hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
during a crisis in the woollen or cotton trade;
and the workers perfectly well knew it themselves.</p>

<p>Whenever a crisis breaks out in some branch
of the petty trades, there is no lack of writers to
predict that that trade is going to disappear.
During the crisis which I witnessed in 1877,
living amidst the Swiss watchmakers, the impossibility
of a recovery of the trade in the face
of the competition of machine-made watches was
a current topic in the press. The same was said
in 1882 with regard to the silk trade of Lyons,
and, in fact, wherever a crisis has broken out in
the petty trades. And yet, notwithstanding the
gloomy predictions, and the still gloomier prospects
of the workers, that form of industry does
not disappear. Even when some branch of it
disappears, there always remains something
of it; some portions of it continue to exist as
small industries (watchmaking of a high quality,
best sorts of silks, high quality velvets, etc.),
or new connected branches grow up instead of
the old ones, or the small industry, taking
advantage of a mechanical motor, assumes a
new form. We thus find it endowed with
an astonishing vitality. It undergoes various
modifications, it adapts itself to new conditions,
it struggles without losing hope of better times
to come. Anyhow, it has not the characteristics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
of a decaying institution. In some industries
the factory is undoubtedly victorious; but there
are other branches in which the petty trades
hold their own position. Even in the textile
industries&mdash;especially in consequence of the wide
use of the labour of children and women&mdash;which
offer so many advantages for the factory system,
the hand-loom still competes with the power-loom.</p>

<p>As a whole, the transformation of the petty
trades into great industries goes on with a slowness
which cannot fail to astonish even those
who are convinced of its necessity. Nay, sometimes
we may even see the reverse movement
going on&mdash;occasionally, of course, and only for
a time. I cannot forget my amazement when
I saw at Verviers, some thirty years ago, that
most of the woollen cloth factories&mdash;immense
barracks facing the streets by more than a
hundred windows each&mdash;were silent, and their
costly machinery was rusting, while cloth was
woven in hand-looms in the weavers’ houses,
for the owners of those very same factories.
Here we have, of course, but a temporary fact,
fully explained by the spasmodic character of
the trade and the heavy losses sustained by the
owners of the factories when they cannot run
their mills all the year round. But it illustrates
the obstacles which the transformation has to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
comply with. As to the silk trade, it continues
to spread over Europe in its rural industry
shape; while hundreds of new petty trades
appear every year, and when they find nobody
to carry them on in the villages&mdash;as is the case
in this country&mdash;they shelter themselves in the
suburbs of the great cities, as we have lately
learned from the inquiry into the “sweating
system.”</p>

<p>Now, the advantages offered by a large factory
in comparison with hand work are self-evident
as regards the economy of labour, and especially&mdash;<em>this
is the main point</em>&mdash;the facilities both for
sale and for having the raw produce at a lower
price. How can we then explain the persistence
of the petty trades? Many causes, however,
most of which cannot be valued in shillings and
pence, are at work in favour of the petty trades,
and these causes will be best seen from the
following illustrations. I must say, however,
that even a brief sketch of the countless industries
which are carried on on a small scale in this
country, and on the Continent, would be far
beyond the scope of this chapter. When I began
to study the subject some thirty years ago, I
never guessed, from the little attention devoted
to it by the orthodox economists, what a wide,
complex, important, and interesting organisation
would appear at the end of a closer inquiry. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
I see myself compelled to give here only a few
typical illustrations, and to indicate the chief
lines only of the subject.</p>


<h3><em>The Small Industries in the United Kingdom.</em></h3>

<p>We have not for the United Kingdom such
statistical data as are obtained in France and
Germany by periodical censuses of all the factories
and workshops, and the numbers of the workpeople,
foremen and clerks, employed on a given
day in each industrial and commercial establishment.
Consequently, up to the present time
all the statements made by economists about
the so-called “concentration” of the industry in
this country, and the consequent “unavoidable”
disappearance of the small industries, have been
based on mere impressions of the writers,&mdash;not
on statistical data. Up till now we cannot give,
as it is done further in these pages for France
and Germany, the exact numbers of factories
and workshops employing, let us say, from 1,000
to 2,000 persons, from 500 to 1,000, from 50 to
500, less than 50, and so on. It is only since
factory inspection has been introduced by the
Factory Act of 1895 that we begin to find, in
the Reports published since 1900 by the Factory
Inspectors (<cite>Annual Report of the Chief Inspector
of Factories and Workshops for the year 1898</cite>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
London, 1900), information which permits us to
get a general idea about the distribution of
working men in factories of different sizes, and
the extension that the petty trades have retained
in this country up till now.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> One may see it
already from the following little table for the
year 1897, which I take from the just-mentioned
Report. These figures are not yet complete,
especially as regards the workshops, but they
contain already the greater part of the English
industries.</p>

<p class="p1">Let me remark that the Factory Inspectors
consider as a <em>workshop</em> every industrial establishment
which has no mechanical motive power,
and as a <em>factory</em> every establishment provided
with steam, gas, water, or electric power.</p>

<p>These figures, however, are not complete,
because only those workshops are included where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
women and children are employed, as also all the
bakeries. The others were not submitted to
inspection at the time when this table was
compiled. There is, nevertheless, a means to
find out the approximate numbers of workpeople
employed in the workshops. The number of
women and female children employed in the
workshops in 1897 was 356,098, and the number
of men and boys was 320,678. But, as the proportion
of male workers to the female in all
the factories was 2,654,716 males to 1,152,308
females, we may admit that the same proportion
prevails in the workshops. This would give
for the latter something like 820,000 male
workers, and 1,176,000 persons of both sexes,
employed in 147,000 workshops. At the same
time, the grand total of persons employed
in industry (exclusive of mining) would be
4,983,000.</p>

<p>We can thus say that <em>nearly one-fourth (24 per
cent.) of all the industrial workers of this country
are working in workshops having less than eight to
ten workers per establishment</em>.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>It must also be pointed out that out of the
4,483,800 workpeople registered in the above-mentioned
tables nearly 60,000 were children
who were working half-days only, 401,000 were
girls less than eighteen years old, 463,000 were
boys from thirteen to eighteen who were making
full working days like the adults, and 1,077,115
were considered as <em>women</em> (more than eighteen
years old). In other words, one-fifth part of all
the industrial workers of this country were girls
and boys, and more than two-fifths (41 per cent.)
were either women or children. All the industrial
production of the United Kingdom, with its immense
exports, was thus <em>giving work to less than
three million adult men</em>&mdash;2,983,000 out of a population
of 42,000,000, to whom we must add
972,200 persons working in the mines. As to the
textile industry, which supplies almost one-half
of the English exports, <em>there are less than</em> 300,000
<em>adult men who find employment in it</em>. The
remainder is the work of children, boys, girls,
and women.</p>

<p>A fact which strikes us is that the 1,051,564<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
workpeople&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;who
worked in 1897 in the textile industries of the
United Kingdom were distributed over 10,883
factories, which gives only an average of ninety-three
persons per factory in all this great industry,
notwithstanding the fact that “concentration”
has progressed most in this industry, and that
we find in it factories employing as many as
5,000 and 6,000 persons.</p>

<p>It is true that the Factory Inspectors represent
each separate branch of a given industry as a
special establishment. Thus, if an employer or
a society owns a spinning mill, a weaving factory,
and a special building for dressing and finishing,
the three are represented as separate factories.
But this is precisely what is wanted for giving
us an exact idea about the degree of concentration
of a given industry. Besides, it is
also known that, for instance, in the cotton
industry, in the neighbourhood of Manchester,
the spinning, the weaving, the dressing and so
on belong very often to different employers, who
send to each other the stuffs at different degrees
of fabrication; those factories which combine
under the same management all the three or four
consecutive phases of the manufacture are an
exception.</p>

<p>But it is especially in the division of the non-textile
industries that we find an enormous de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>velopment
of small factories. The 2,755,460
workpeople who are employed in all the non-textile
branches, with the exception of mining,
are scattered in 79,059 factories, each of which has
only an average of thirty-five workers. Moreover,
the Factory Inspectors had on their lists
676,776 workpeople employed in 88,814 workshops
(without mechanical power), which makes
an average of eight persons only per workshop.
These last figures are, however, as we saw, below
the real ones, as another sixty thousand workshops
occupying half a million more workpeople
were not yet tabulated.</p>

<p>Such averages as <em>ninety-three and thirty-five
workpeople per factory, and eight per workshop</em>,
distributed over 178,756 industrial establishments,
destroy already the legend according to
which the big factories have already absorbed
most of the small ones. The figures show, on
the contrary, what an immense number of small
factories and workshops resist the absorption by
the big factories, and how they multiply by the
side of the great industry in various branches,
especially those of recent origin.</p>

<p>If we had for the United Kingdom full
statistics, giving lists of all the factories, with
the number of workpeople employed in each
of them, as we have for France and Germany
(see below), it would have been easy to find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
exact number of factories employing more
than 1,000, 500, 100, and 50 workmen. But
such lists are issued only for the mining industry.
As to the statistics published by the
Factory Inspectors, they do not contain such
data, perhaps because the inspectors have no
time to tabulate their figures, or have not the
right to do so. Be it as it may, the Report
of Mr. Whitelegge for 1897 gives the number
of factories (textile and non-textile) and workshops
for each of the 119 counties of the United
Kingdom and for each of the nearly hundred
sub-divisions of all the industries, as well as
the number of workpeople in each of these
more than 10,000 sub-divisions. So I was
enabled to calculate the <em>averages</em> of persons
employed in the factories and workshops for
each separate branch of industry in each
county. Besides, Mr. Whitelegge has had the
kindness to give me two very important figures&mdash;namely,
the number of factories employing
more than 1,000 workpeople, and the number
of those <em>factories</em> where less than ten workers
are employed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us take, first of all, the <span class="allsmcap">TEXTILE</span> industries,
which include cotton, wool, silk, linen,
jute, and hemp, as well as machine-made
lace and knitting. Many of my readers will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
probably be astonished to learn that even in
the cotton industry a great number of quite
small factories continue to exist up to the
present day. Even in the West Riding district,
which is second only to Lancashire for
the number of its cotton mills, and where we
find nearly one-third of all the workpeople employed
in the cotton industry (237,444 persons),
the average for all the 3,210 factories of this
district is only seventy-three persons per factory.
And even in Lancashire, where we find nearly
one-half of all the workpeople employed in the
textiles, these 434,609 men, women, and children
are scattered in 3,132 factories, each of which
has thus an average of only 139 workers. If
we remember that in this number there are
factories employing from 2,000 to 6,000 persons,
one cannot but be struck by the quantity of
small factories employing less than 100 persons,
and which continue to exist by the side of the
great cotton mills. But we shall just see that
the same is true for all industries.</p>

<p>As to Nottinghamshire, which is a centre
for machine-made lace and knitting, its 18,434
workpeople are, most of them, working in
small factories. The average for the 386 establishments
of this county is only forty-eight
persons per factory. The great industry is thus
very far from having absorbed the small one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span></p>

<p>The distribution of the textile factories in
the other counties of the United Kingdom is
even more instructive. We learn that there
are nearly 2,000 textile factories in forty-nine
counties, and everyone of these factories has
much less than 100 workpeople; while a
very considerable number of them employ
only from forty to fifty, from ten to twenty,
and even less than ten persons.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>This could have been foreseen by everyone
who has some practical knowledge of industry,
but it is overlooked by the theorists, who
know industry mostly from books. In every
country of the world there are by the side of
the large factories a great number of small
ones, the success of which is due to the variety
of their produce and the facilities they offer
to follow the vagaries of fashion. This is
especially true with regard to the woollens and
the mixed stuffs made of wool and cotton.</p>

<p>Besides, it is well known to British manufacturers
that at the time when the big cotton
mills were established, the manufacturers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
spinning and weaving machinery, seeing that
they had no more orders coming, after they
had supplied this machinery to the great
factories, began to offer it at a reduced price
and on credit to the small weavers. These
last associated&mdash;three, five, or more of them&mdash;to
buy the machinery, and this is why we
have now in Lancashire quite a region where a
great number of small cotton mills continue to
exist till nowadays, without there being any
reason to foresee their disappearance. At times
they are even quite prosperous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the other side, when we examine the
various branches of textile industry (cotton,
wool, silk, jute, etc.), we see that if the great
factories dominate in the spinning and weaving
of cotton, worsted and flax, as well as in
the spinning of silk (the result being that the
average for these branches reaches 150 workers
per factory for cotton, and 267 for the spinning
of flax), <em>all other textile industries belong to the
domain of the middle-sized and the small industry</em>.
In other words, in the manufacture of
woollens, shoddy, hemp, hair, machine-made
lace, and mechanical knitting, as also in the
weaving of silks, there are, of course, large
factories; but the majority of these establishments
belong to the domain of the small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
industry. Thus, for the 3,274 woollen factories,
the average is only from twenty to fifty workers
per factory; it is also from twenty-seven to
thirty-eight for shoddy, and thirty-seven to
seventy-six for the other branches. Only for
knitting do the averages rise to ninety-three
persons per factory; but we are just going to
see that the small industry reappears in this
branch in force under the name of workshops.</p>

<p>All these important branches of the British
textile industry, which give work to more than
240,000 men and women, have thus remained
up till now at the stage of a small and middle-sized
industry.</p>

<p>If we take now the <span class="allsmcap">NON-TEXTILE</span> industries,
we find, on the one side, an immense number
of small industries which have grown up around
the great ones, and owing to them; and, on the
other side, a large part of the fundamental
industries have remained in the stage of small
establishments. The average for all these
branches, which give occupation to three-fourths
of all the industrial workers of the
United Kingdom&mdash;that is, 2,755,460 workers&mdash;hardly
attains, we saw, thirty-five persons per
factory&mdash;the workshops being not yet included
in this division. However, it is especially
when we go into details, and analyse the
figures which I have calculated for each separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
branch, that we fully realise the importance of
the petty trades in England. This is what we
are going to do, mentioning first what belongs
here to the great industry, and studying next
the small one.</p>

<p>Following the classification adopted by the
Factory Inspectors, we see first that the gas-works
belong to the domain of the fairly big
establishments (seventy-eight people on the
average). The india-rubber factories belong to
the same category (125 workers on the average);
and amidst the 456 glass-works of the United
Kingdom there must be some big ones, as the
average is eighty-seven workpeople.</p>

<p>Next come mining and metallurgy, which
are carried on, as a rule, on a great scale; but
already in the iron foundries we find a
great number of establishments belonging to
the middle-sized and small industry. Thus at
Sheffield I saw myself several foundries employing
only from five to six workmen. For
the making of huge machinery there is, of course,
a number of very large works, such as those
of Armstrong, Whitworth, or those of the State
at Woolwich. But it is very instructive to see
how very small works prosper by the side of
big ones; they are numerous enough to reduce
the average to seventy workers per establishment
for the 5,318 works of this category.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span></p>

<p>Shipbuilding and the manufacture of metallic
tubes evidently belong to the great industry
(averages, 243 and 156 persons per establishment);
and the same applies to the two great
metallurgical works of the State, which employ
between them 23,455 workmen.</p>

<p>Going over to the chemical works, we find
again a great industry in the fabrication of
alkalies and of matches (only twenty-five works);
but, on the contrary, the fabrication of soap
and candles, as well as manures and all other
sorts of chemical produce, which represents
nearly 2,000 factories, belongs almost entirely
to the domain of the small industry. The
average is only twenty-nine workpeople per
factory. There are, of course, half a dozen of
very large soap works&mdash;one knows them only
too well by their advertisements on the cliffs
and in the fields; but the low average of
twenty-nine workmen proves how many small
factories must exist by the side of the soap
kings. The 2,500 works engaged in the fabrication
of furniture, both in wood and in
iron, belong again chiefly to the small industry.
The small and very small factories swarm by
the side of a few great ones, to say nothing
of the thousands of the still smaller workshops.
The great storehouses of our cities
are for the most part mere exhibitions of fur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>niture
made in very small factories and workshops.</p>

<p>In the fabrication of food produce we find
several great sugar, chocolate, and preserves
works; but by their side we find also a very
great number of small establishments, which
seem not to complain of the proximity of the
big ones, as they occupy nearly two-thirds
of the workers employed in this branch. I
do not speak, of course, of the village windmills,
but one cannot fail to be struck by
the immense number of small breweries
(2,076 breweries have on the average only
twenty-four workmen each) and of the establishments
engaged in the fabrication of aerated
waters (they number 3,365, and have on the
average only eleven operatives per establishment).</p>

<p>In calico-printing we enter once more the
domain of great factories; but by their side we
find a pretty large number of small ones; so
that the average for all this category is 144
workpeople per factory. We find also fourteen
great factories, having an average of 394 workpeople
each, for dyeing in Turkey red. But
we find also by their side more than 100,000
working-men employed in 2,725 small establishments
of this class&mdash;bleaching, dressing,
packing, and so on&mdash;and this gives us one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
more illustration of numerous small industries
growing round the main ones.</p>

<p>In the making of ready-made clothing and
the fabrication of hats, linen, boots and shoes,
and gloves, we see the averages for the factories
of this description going up to 80, 100,
and 150 persons per factory. But it is here
also that countless small workshops come in.
It must also be noticed that most of the factories
of ready-made clothing have their own
special character. The factory buys the cloth
and makes the cutting by means of special
machinery; but the sewing is done by women,
who come to work in the factory. They pay so
much the sewing-machine, so much the motor
power (if there is one), so much the gas, so
much the iron, and so on, and they are on
piece work. Very often this becomes a “sweating
system” on a large scale. Round the big
factories a great number of small workshops
are centred.</p>

<p>And, finally, we find great factories for the
fabrication of gunpowder and explosives (they
employ less than 12,000 workpeople), stuff
buttons, and umbrellas (only 6,000 employees).
But we find also in the table of workshops that
in these last two branches there are thousands
of them by the side of a few great factories.</p>

<p>All taken, Mr. Whitelegge writes to me that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
of factories employing more than 1,000 workpeople
each, he finds <em>only sixty-five in the
textile industries</em> (102,600 workpeople) and only
128 (355,208 workpeople) <em>in all non-textile
industries</em>.</p>

<p>In this brief enumeration we have gone over
all that belongs to the great industry. The
remainder belongs almost entirely to the domain
of the small, and often the very small industry.
Such are all the factories for woodwork,
which have on the average only fifteen
men per establishment, but represent a contingent
of more than 100,000 workmen and more
than 6,000 employers. The tanneries, the manufacture
of all sorts of little things in ivory and
bone, and even the brick-works and the potteries,
representing a total of 260,000 workpeople
and 11,200 employers, belong, with a
very few exceptions, to the small industry.</p>

<p>Then we have the factories dealing with
the burnishing and enamelling of metals, which
also belong chiefly to the small industry&mdash;the
average being only twenty-eight workpeople
per factory. But what is especially striking is
the development of the small and very small
industry in the fabrication of agricultural
machinery (thirty-two workers per factory), of
all sorts of tools (twenty-two on the average),
needles and pins (forty-three), ironmongery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
sanitary apparatus, and various instruments
(twenty-five), even of boilers (forty-eight per
factory), chains, cables, and anchors (in many
districts this work, as also the making of nails,
is made by hand by <em>women</em>).</p>

<p>Needless to say that the fabrication of furniture,
which occupies nearly 64,000 operatives,
belongs chiefly&mdash;more than three-fourths
of it&mdash;to the small industry. The
average for the 1,979 factories of this branch
is only twenty-one workpeople, the workshops
not being included in this number. The
same is true of the factories for the curing of
fish, machine-made pastry, and so on, which
occupy 38,030 workpeople in more than 2,700
factories, having thus an average of fourteen
operatives each.</p>

<p>Jewelry and the manufacture of watches,
photographic apparatus, and all sorts of luxury
articles, again belong to the small and very
small industry, and give occupation to 54,000
persons.</p>

<p>All that belongs to printing, lithography,
bookbinding, and stationery again represents
a vast field occupied by the small industry,
which prospers by the side of a small number of
very large establishments. More than 120,000
are employed in these branches in more than
6,000 factories (workshops not yet included).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span></p>

<p>And, finally, we find a large domain occupied
by saddlery, brush-making, the making of sails,
basket-making, and the fabrication of a thousand
little things in leather, paper, wood, metal,
and so on. This class is certainly not insignificant,
as it contains more than 4,300 employers
and nearly 130,000 workpeople, employed in
a mass of very small factories by the side of a
few very great ones, the average being only
from twenty-five to thirty-five persons per
factory.</p>

<p>In short, in the different non-textile industries,
the inspectors have tabulated <em>32,042
factories employing, each of them, less than ten
workpeople</em>.</p>

<p>All taken, we find 270,000 workpeople employed
in small factories having less than fifty
and even twenty workers each, the result being
that the very great industry (the factories
employing more than 1,000 workpeople per
factory) and the very small one (less than ten
workers) employ nearly the same number
of operatives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The important part played by the small
industry in this country fully appears from
this rapid sketch. And I have not yet
spoken of the workshops. The Factory Inspectors
mentioned, as we saw, in their first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
report, 88,814 workshops, in which 676,776
workpeople (356,098 women) were employed
in 1897. But, as we have already seen, these
figures are incomplete. The number of workshops
is about 147,000, and there must be
about 1,200,000 persons employed in them
(820,000 men and about 356,000 women and
children).</p>

<p>It is evident that this class comprises a very
considerable number of bakers, small carpenters,
tailors, cobblers, cartwrights, village smiths,
and so on. But there is also in this class an
immense number of workshops belonging to industry,
properly speaking&mdash;that is, workshops
which manufacture for the great commercial
market. Some of these workshops may of
course employ fifty persons or more, but the
immense majority employ only from five to
twenty workpeople each.</p>

<p>We thus find in this class 1,348 small establishments,
scattered both in the villages and
the suburbs of great cities, where nearly 14,000
persons make lace, knitting, embroidery, and
weaving in hand-looms; more than 100 small
tanneries, more than 20,000 cartwrights, and
746 small bicycle makers. In cutlery, in the
fabrication of tools and small arms, nails and
screws, and even anchors and anchor chains,
we find again many thousands of small work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>shops
employing something like 60,000 workmen.
All that, let us remember, without
counting those workshops which employ no
women or children, and therefore are not
submitted to the Factory Inspectors. As to
the fabrication of clothing, which gives work to
more than 350,000 men and women, distributed
over nearly 45,000 workshops, let it be noted
that it is not small tailors that is spoken
of here, but that mass of <em>workshops</em> which
swarm in Whitechapel and the suburbs of all
great cities, and where we find from five to
fifty women and men making clothing for the
tailor shops, big and small. In these shops
the measure is taken, and sometimes the
cutting is made; but the clothing is sewn in
the small workshops, which are very often
somewhere in the country. Even parts of the
commands of linen and clothing for the army
find their way to workshops in country places.
As to the underclothing and mercery which
are sold in the great stores, they are fabricated
in small workshops, which must be counted by
the thousand.</p>

<p>The same is true of furniture, mattresses and
cushions, hats, artificial flowers, umbrellas,
slippers, and even cheap jewelry. The great
shops, even the largest stores, mostly keep only
an assortment of samples. All is manufactured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
at a very low price, and <em>day by day</em>, in thousands
of small workshops.</p>

<p>It can thus be said that if we exclude from
the class of workshops’ employees 100,000 or
even 200,000 workpeople who do not work
for <em>industry</em> properly speaking, and if we add
on the other side the nearly 500,000 workers
who have not yet been tabulated by the inspectors
in 1897, we find a population of more
than 1,000,000 men and women who belong
entirely to the domain of the small industry,
and so must be added to those whom we
found working in the small factories. The
artisans who are working single-handed were
not included in this sketch.</p>

<p>We thus see that even in this country, which
may be considered as representing the highest
development of the great industry, the number
of persons employed in the small trade continues
to be immense. The small industries
are as much a distinctive feature of the British
industry as its few immense factories and
ironworks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Going over now to what is known about the
small industries of this country from direct
observation, we find that the suburbs of London,
Glasgow, and other great cities swarm with small
workshops, and that there are regions where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
petty trades are as developed as they are in
Switzerland or in Germany. Sheffield is a well-known
example in point. The Sheffield cutlery&mdash;one
of the glories of England&mdash;is <em>not</em> made by
machinery: it is chiefly made by hand. There
are at Sheffield a number of firms which manufacture
cutlery right through from the making of
steel to the finishing of tools, and employ wage-workers;
and yet even these firms&mdash;I am told
by Edward Carpenter, who kindly collected for
me information about the Sheffield trade&mdash;let
out some part of their work to the “small
masters.” But by far the greatest number of the
cutlers work in their homes with their relatives,
or in small workshops supplied with wheel-power,
which they rent for a few shillings a week.
Immense yards are covered with buildings, which
are subdivided into numbers of small workshops.
Some of these cover but a few square yards, and
there I saw smiths hammering, all the day long,
blades of knives on a small anvil, close by the
blaze of their fires; occasionally the smith may
have one helper, or two. In the upper storeys
scores of small workshops are supplied with
wheel-power, and in each of them, three, four, or
five workers and a “master” fabricate, with
the occasional aid of a few plain machines, every
description of tools: files, saws, blades of knives,
razors, and so on. Grinding and glazing are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
done in other small workshops, and even steel
is cast in a small foundry, the working staff of
which consists only of five or six men.</p>

<p>When I walked through these workshops I
easily imagined myself in a Russian cutlery
village, like Pavlovo or Vorsma. The Sheffield
cutlery has thus maintained its olden organisation,
and the fact is the more remarkable as the
earnings of the cutlers are low as a rule; but,
even when they are reduced to a few shillings a
week, the cutler prefers to vegetate on his small
earnings than to enter as a waged labourer in a
“house.” The spirit of the old trade organisations,
which were so much spoken of in the ’sixties
of the nineteenth century, is thus still alive.</p>

<p>Until lately, Leeds and its environs were also
the seat of extensive domestic industries. When
Edward Baines wrote, in 1857, his first account of
the Yorkshire industries (in Th. Baines’s <cite>Yorkshire,
Past and Present</cite>), most of the woollen cloth
which was made in that region was woven by
hand.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Twice a week the hand-made cloth was
brought to the Clothiers’ Hall, and by noon it
was sold to the merchants, who had it dressed
in their factories. Joint-stock mills were run
by combined clothiers in order to prepare and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
spin the wool, but it was woven in the hand-looms
by the clothiers and the members of their families.
Twelve years later the hand-loom was superseded
to a great extent by the power-loom; but the
clothiers, who were anxious to maintain their independence,
resorted to a peculiar organisation:
they rented a room, or part of a room, and sometimes
also the power-looms, and they worked
independently&mdash;a characteristic organisation
partly maintained until now, and well adapted
to illustrate the efforts of the petty traders to
keep their ground, notwithstanding the competition
of the factory. And it must be said
that the triumphs of the factory were too often
achieved only by means of the most fraudulent
adulteration and the underpaid labour of the
children.</p>

<p>The variety of domestic industries carried on
in the Lake District is much greater than might
be expected, but they still wait for careful
explorers. I will only mention the hoop-makers,
the basket trade, the charcoal-burners, the
bobbin-makers, the small iron furnaces working
with charcoal at Backbarrow, and so on.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> As
a whole, we do not well know the petty trades of
this country, and therefore we sometimes come
across quite unexpected facts. Few continental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
writers on industrial topics would guess, indeed,
that twenty-five years ago nails were made by
hand by thousands of men, women, and children
in the Black Country of South Staffordshire, as
also in Derbyshire,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and that some of this industry
remains still in existence, or that the best needles
are made by hand at Redditch. Chains are also
made by hand at Dudley and Cradley, and although
the Press is periodically moved to speak
of the wretched conditions of the chain-makers,
men and women, the trade still maintains itself;
while nearly 7,000 men were busy in 1890 in their
small workshops in making locks, even of the
plainest description, at Walsall, Wolverhampton,
and Willenhall. The various ironmongeries
connected with horse-clothing&mdash;bits, spurs,
bridles, and so on&mdash;are also largely made by
hand at Walsall.</p>

<p>The Birmingham gun and rifle trades, which
also belong to the same domain of small industries,
are well known. As to the various branches of
dress, there are still important divisions of the
United Kingdom where a variety of domestic
trades connected with dress is carried on on a
large scale. I need only mention the cottage
industries of Ireland, as also some of them which
have survived in the shires of Buckingham,
Oxford, and Bedford; hosiery is a common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
occupation in the villages of the counties of
Nottingham and Derby; and several great
London firms send out cloth to be made into dress
in the villages of Sussex and Hampshire. Woollen
hosiery is at home in the villages of Leicester,
and especially in Scotland; straw-plaiting and
hat-making in many parts of the country;
while at Northampton, Leicester, Ipswich, and
Stafford shoemaking was, till quite lately, a
widely spread domestic occupation, or was carried
on in small workshops; even at Norwich it
remains a petty trade to some extent, notwithstanding
the competition of the factories. It
must also be said that the recent appearance of
large boot and shoe factories has considerably
increased the number of girls and women who sew
the “uppers” and embroider the slippers, either
in their own houses or in sweaters’ workshops,
while new small factories have developed of late
for the making of heels, card-boxes, and so on.</p>

<p>The petty trades are thus an important factor
of industrial life even in Great Britain, although
many of them have gathered into the towns.
But if we find in this country so many fewer
rural industries than on the Continent, we must
not imagine that their disappearance is due
only to a keener competition of the factories.
The chief cause was the compulsory exodus from
the villages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span></p>

<p>As everyone knows from Thorold Rogers’
work, the growth of the factory system in England
was intimately connected with that enforced
exodus. Whole industries, which prospered till
then, were killed downright by the forced clearing
of estates.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The workshops, much more even
than the factories, multiply wherever they find
cheap labour; and the specific feature of this
country is, that the cheapest labour&mdash;that is, the
greatest number of destitute people&mdash;is to be
found in the great cities. The agitation raised
(with no result) in connection with the “Dwellings
of the Poor,” the “Unemployed,” and the
“Sweating System,” has fully disclosed that
characteristic feature of the economic life of
England and Scotland; and the painstaking
researches made by Mr. Charles Booth have
shown that one-quarter of the population of London&mdash;that
is, 1,000,000 out of the 3,800,000 who
entered within the scope of his inquest&mdash;would be
happy if the heads of their families could have
regular earnings of something like £1 a week all
the year round. Half of them would be satisfied
with even less than that. The same state
of things was found by Mr. Seebohm Rowntree
at York.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Cheap labour is offered in such
quantities in the suburbs of all the great cities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
of Great Britain, that the petty and domestic
trades, which are scattered on the Continent in
the villages, gather in this country in the cities.</p>

<p>Exact figures as to the small industries are
wanting, but a simple walk through the suburbs
of London would do much to realise the variety
of petty trades which swarm in the metropolis,
and, in fact, in all chief urban agglomerations.
The evidence given before the “Sweating
System Committee” has shown how far the furniture
and ready-made clothing palaces and the
“Bonheur des Dames” bazaars of London are
mere exhibitions of samples, or markets for
the sale of the produce of the small industries.
Thousands of sweaters, some of them having
their own workshops, and others merely distributing
work to sub-sweaters who distribute
it again amidst the destitute, supply those
palaces and bazaars with goods made in the
slums or in very small workshops. The commerce
<em>is</em> centralised in those bazaars&mdash;not the
industry. The furniture palaces and bazaars
are thus merely playing the part which the
feudal castle formerly played in agriculture:
they centralise the profits&mdash;not the production.</p>

<p>In reality, the extension of the petty trades,
side by side with the great factories, is nothing
to be wondered at. It is an economic necessity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
The absorption of the small workshops by bigger
concerns is a fact which had struck the economists
in the ’forties of the last century, especially
in the textile trades. It is continued still in
many other trades, and is especially striking in a
number of very big concerns dealing with metals
and war supplies for the different States. But
there is another process which is going on parallel
with the former, and which consists in the
continuous creation of new industries, usually
making their start on a small scale. Each
new factory calls into existence a number of
small workshops, partly to supply its own needs
and partly to submit its produce to a further
transformation. Thus, to quote but one instance,
the cotton mills have created an immense demand
for wooden bobbins and reels, and thousands of
men in the Lake District set to manufacture
them&mdash;by hand first, and later on with the aid
of some plain machinery. Only quite recently,
after years had been spent in inventing and
improving the machinery, the bobbins began to
be made on a larger scale in factories. And
even yet, as the machines are very costly, a great
quantity of bobbins are made in small workshops,
with but little aid from machines, while
the factories themselves are relatively small,
and seldom employ more than fifty operatives&mdash;chiefly
children. As to the reels of irregular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
shape, they are still made by hand, or partly
with the aid of small machines, continually invented
by the workers. New industries thus
grow up to supplant the old ones; each of them
passes through a preliminary stage on a small
scale before reaching the great factory stage;
and the more active the inventive genius of a
nation is, the more it has of these budding
industries. The countless small bicycle works
which have lately grown up in this country,
and are supplied with ready-made parts of the
bicycle by the larger factories, are an instance
in point. The domestic and small workshops
fabrication of boxes for matches, boots, hats,
confectionery, grocery and so on is another
familiar instance.</p>

<p>Besides, the large factory stimulates the birth
of new petty trades by creating new wants.
The cheapness of cottons and woollens, of paper
and brass, has created hundreds of new small
industries. Our households are full of their
produce&mdash;mostly things of quite modern invention.
And while some of them already are
turned out by the million in the great factory,
all have passed through the small workshop
stage, before the demand was great enough to
require the great factory organisation. The more
we may have of new inventions, the more shall
we have of such small industries; and again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
the more we have of them, the more shall we
have of the inventive genius, the want of which
is so justly complained of in this country (by
W. Armstrong, amongst many others). We
must not wonder, therefore, if we see so many
small trades in this country; but we must regret
that the great number have abandoned the
villages in consequence of the bad conditions of
land tenure, and that they have migrated in such
numbers to the cities, to the detriment of agriculture.</p>

<p>In England, as everywhere, the small industries
are an important factor in the industrial life of
the country; and it is chiefly in the infinite
variety of the small trades, which utilise the
half-fabricated produce of the great industries,
that inventive genius is developed, and the rudiments
of the future great industries are elaborated.
The small bicycle workshops, with the hundreds
of small improvements which they introduced,
have been under our very eyes the primary cells
out of which the great industry of the motor
cars, and later on of the aeroplanes, has grown
up. The small village jam-makers were the
precursors and the rudiments of the great factories
of preserves which now employ hundreds
of workers. And so on.</p>

<p>Consequently, to affirm that the small industries
are doomed to disappear, while we see new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
ones appear every day, is merely to repeat a
hasty generalisation that was made in the earlier
part of the nineteenth century by those who
witnessed the absorption of hand-work by
machinery work in the cotton industry&mdash;a
generalisation which, as we saw already, and
are going still better to see on the following
pages, finds no confirmation from the study of
industries, great and small, and is upset by the
censuses of the factories and workshops. Far
from showing a tendency to disappear, the small
industries show, on the contrary, a tendency towards
making a further development, since the
municipal supply of electrical power&mdash;such as
we have, for instance, in Manchester&mdash;permits
the owner of a small factory to have a cheap
supply of motive power, exactly in the proportion
required at a given time, and to pay only for
what is really consumed.</p>


<h3><em>Petty Trades in France.</em></h3>

<p>Small industries are met with in France in a
very great variety, and they represent a most
important feature of national economy. It is
estimated, in fact, that while one-half of the
population of France live upon agriculture, and
one-third upon industry, this third part is equally
distributed between the great industry and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
small one.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> This last occupies about 1,650,000
workers and supports from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000
persons. A considerable number of peasants
who resort to small industries without abandoning
agriculture would have to be added to the
just-mentioned items, and the additional earnings
which these peasants find in industry are so
important that in several parts of France peasant
proprietorship could not be maintained without
the aid derived from the rural industries.</p>

<p>The small peasants know what they have to
expect the day they become factory hands in a
town; and so long as they have not been dispossessed
by the money-lender of their lands and
houses, and so long as the village rights in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
communal grazing grounds or woods have not
been lost, they cling to a combination of industry
with agriculture. Having, in most cases, no
horses to plough the land, they resort to an
arrangement which is widely spread, if not
universal, among small French landholders, even
in purely rural districts (I saw it even in Haute-Savoie).
One of the peasants who keeps a
plough and a team of horses tills all the fields
in turn. At the same time, owing to a wide
maintenance of the communal spirit, which I
have described elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> further support is
found in the communal shepherd, the communal
wine-press, and various forms of “aids” amongst
the peasants. And wherever the village-community
spirit is maintained, the small industries
persist, while no effort is spared to bring the small
plots under higher culture.</p>

<p>Market-gardening and fruit culture often go
hand in hand with small industries. And
wherever well-being is found on a relatively
unproductive soil, it is nearly always due to a
combination of the two sister arts.</p>

<p>The most wonderful adaptations of the small
industries to new requirements, and substantial
technical progress in the methods of production,
can be noted at the same time. It may even be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
said of France, as it has been said of Russia, that
when a rural industry dies out, the cause of its
decay is found much less in the competition of
rival factories&mdash;in hundreds of localities the small
industry undergoes a complete modification, or
it changes its character in such cases&mdash;than in
the decay of the population <em>as agriculturists</em>.
Continually we see that only when the small
landholders have been ruined, as such, by a
group of causes&mdash;the loss of communal meadows,
or abnormally high rents, or the havoc made in
some locality by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marchands de biens</i> (swindlers
enticing the peasants to buy land on credit),
or the bankruptcy of some shareholders’ company
whose shares had been eagerly taken by
the peasants<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>&mdash;only then do they abandon both
the land and the rural industry and emigrate
towards the towns.</p>

<p>Otherwise, a new industry always grows up
when the competition of the factory becomes
too acute&mdash;a wonderful, hardly suspected
adaptability being displayed by the small industries;
or else the rural artisans resort to
some form of intensive farming, gardening, etc.,
and in the meantime some other industry makes
its appearance. A closer study of France under
this aspect is instructive in a high degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span></p>

<p>It is evident that in most textile industries
the power-loom supersedes the hand-loom, and
the factory takes, or has taken already, the place
of the cottage industry. Cottons, plain linen,
and machine-made lace are now produced at such
a low cost by machinery that hand-weaving
evidently becomes an anachronism for the
plainest descriptions of such goods. Consequently,
though there were in France, in the
year 1876, 328,300 hand-looms as against 121,340
power-looms, it may safely be taken that the
number of the former has been considerably
reduced within the next twenty years. However,
the slowness with which this change is
being accomplished is one of the most striking
features of the present industrial organisation
of the textile trades of France.</p>

<p>The causes of this power of resistance of hand-loom-weaving
become especially apparent when
one consults such works as Reybaud’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Coton</cite>,
which was written in 1863, nearly half a century
ago&mdash;that is, at a time when the cottage industries
were still fully alive. Though an ardent admirer
himself of the great industries, Reybaud faithfully
noted the striking superiority of well-being
in the weavers’ cottages as compared with the
misery of the factory hands in the cities. Already
then, the cities of St. Quentin, Lille,
Roubaix and Amiens were great centres for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
cotton-spinning mills and cotton-weaving factories.
But, at the same time, all sorts of cottons
were woven in hand-looms, in the very suburbs
of St. Quentin and in a hundred villages and
hamlets around it, to be sold for finishing in the
city. And Reybaud remarked that the horrible
dwellings in town, and the general condition of
the factory hands, stood in a wonderful contrast
with the relative welfare of the rural weavers.
Nearly every one of these last had his own house
and a small field which he continued to cultivate.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Even in such a branch as the fabrication of
plain cotton velvets, in which the competition
of the factories was especially keenly felt, home-weaving
was widely spread, in 1863 and even in
1878, in the villages round Amiens. Although
the earnings of the rural weavers were small,
as a rule, the weavers preferred to keep to their
own cottages, to their own crops and to their
own cattle; and only repeated commercial
crises, as well as several of the above-mentioned
causes, hostile to the small peasant, compelled
most of them to give up the struggle, and to
seek employment in the factories, while part of
them have, by this time, again returned to
agriculture or taken to market-gardening.</p>

<p>Another important centre for rural industries
was in the neighbourhood of Rouen, where no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
less than 110,000 persons were employed, in
1863, in weaving cottons for the finishing factories
of that city. In the valley of the Andelle,
in the department of Eure, each village was at
that time an industrial bee-hive; each streamlet
was utilised for setting into work a small
factory. Reybaud described the condition of
the peasants who combined agriculture with
work at the rural factory as most satisfactory,
especially in comparison with the condition of
the slum-dwellers at Rouen, and he even mentioned
a case or two in which the village factories
belonged to the village communities.</p>

<p>Seventeen years later, Baudrillart<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> depicted
the same region in very much the same words;
and although the rural factories had had to
yield to a great extent before the big factories,
the rural industry was still valued as
showing a yearly production of 85,000,000
francs (£2,400,000).</p>

<p>At the present time, the factories must have
made further progress; but we still see from
the excellent descriptions of M. Ardouin Dumazet,
whose work will have in the future
almost the same value as Arthur Young’s
<cite>Travels</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> that a considerable portion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
rural weavers has still survived; while at the
same time one invariably meets, even nowadays,
with the remark that relative well-being is
prominent in the villages in which weaving
is connected with agriculture.</p>

<p>Up to the present time, M. Ardouin Dumazet
writes, “there is an industry which gives
work to many hand-looms in the villages; it is
the weaving of various stuffs for umbrellas and
ladies’ boots.” Amiens is the chief centre for
this weaving.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> In other places they are making
dresses out of Amiens velvet and various stuffs
woven at Roubaix. It is a new industry; it
has taken the place of the old one, which
was making of Amiens a second Lyons.</p>

<p>In the district of Le Thelle, to the south of
Beauvais, there is “a multitude of petty trades,
of which one hardly imagines the importance.
I have seen,” M. Dumazet says, “small factories
of buttons made from bone, ivory, or mother-of-pearl,
brushes, shoe-horns, keys for pianos,
dominoes, counters and dice, spectacle-cases,
small articles for the writing-table, handles for
tools, measures, billiard keys&mdash;what not!...
There is not one single village, however small,
the population of which should not have its own
industry.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> At the same time it must not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
be forgotten that thousands of small articles
for the writing-table and for draughtsmen are
fabricated on a large scale in the small factories
in the same region. Some of the workshops
are situated in private houses, and in some of
them artistic work is made; but most of them
are located in special houses, where the necessary
power is hired by the owner of the workshop.
You see here “a fantastic activity”&mdash;the
word is M. Dumazet’s; the division of
labour is very great, and everywhere they
invent new machine-tools.</p>

<p>Finally, in the villages of the Vermandois
district (department of the Aisne), we find a
considerable number of hand-looms (more than
3,000) upon which mixed stuffs made of cotton,
wool and silk are woven.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Of course, it must be recognised that, as a
rule, in northern France, where cottons are
fabricated on a large scale in factory towns,
hand-weaving in the villages is nearly gone.
But, as is seen already from the preceding, new
small industries have grown up instead, and
this is also the case in many other parts of France.</p>

<p>Taking the region situated between Rouen
in the north-east, Orléans in the south-east,
Rennes in the north-west, and Nantes in the
south-west&mdash;that is, the old provinces of Normandy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
Perche and Maine, and partly Touraine
and Anjou, as they were seen by Ardouin
Dumazet in 1895&mdash;we find there quite a variety
of domestic and petty industries, both in the
villages and in the towns.</p>

<p>At Laval (to the south-east of Rennes), where
drills (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coutils</i>) were formerly woven out of flax
in hand-looms, and at Alençon, formerly a
great centre for the cottage-weaving of linen,
as well as for hand-made lace, Ardouin Dumazet
found both the house and the factory linen
industry in a lingering state. Cotton takes the
lead. Drills are now made out of cotton in the
factories, and the demand for flax goods is
very small. Both domestic and factory weaving
of flax goods are accordingly in a poor condition.
The cottagers abandoned that branch of weaving,
and the large factories, which had been erected at
Alençon with the intention of creating a flax and
hemp-cloth industry, had to be closed. Only one
factory, occupying 250 hands, remains; while
nearly 23,000 weavers, who found occupation
at Mans, Fresnay and Alençon in hemp cloths
and fine linen, had to abandon that industry.
Those who worked in factories have emigrated
to other towns, while those who had not broken
with agriculture reverted to it. In this struggle
of cotton <em>versus</em> flax and hemp, the former was
victorious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span></p>

<p>As to lace, it is made in such quantities by
machinery at Calais, Caudry, St. Quentin and
Tarare that only high-class artistic lace-making
continues on a small scale at Alençon itself,
but it still remains a by-occupation in the
surrounding country. Besides, at Flers, and at
Ferté Macé (a small town to the south of the
former), hand-weaving is still carried on in
about 5,400 hand-looms, although the whole
trade, in factories and villages alike, is in a
piteous state since the Spanish markets have
been lost. Spain has now plenty of her own
cotton mills. Twelve big spinning mills at
Condé (where 4,000 tons of cotton were spun in
1883) were abandoned in 1893, and the workers
were thrown into a most miserable condition.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>On the contrary, in an industry which supplies
the home market&mdash;namely, in the fabrication
of linen handkerchiefs, which itself is of a quite
recent growth&mdash;we see that cottage-weaving is,
even now, in full prosperity. Cholet (in Maine-et-Loire,
south-west of Angers) is the centre of
that trade. It has one spinning mill and one
weaving mill, but both employ considerably
fewer hands than domestic weaving, which is
spread over no less than 200 villages of the surrounding
region.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Neither at Rouen nor in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
the industrial cities of Northern France are so
many linen handkerchiefs fabricated as in this
region in hand-looms, we are told by Ardouin
Dumazet.</p>

<p>Within the curve made by the Loire as it flows
past Orléans we find another prosperous centre
of domestic industries connected with cottons.
“From Romorantin [in Loire-et-Cher, south of
Orléans] to Argenton and Le Blanc,” the same
writer says, “we have one immense workshop
where handkerchiefs are embroidered, and
shirts, cuffs, collars and all sorts of ladies’ linen
are sewn or embroidered. There is not one
house, even in the tiniest hamlets, where the
women would not be occupied in that trade ...
and if this work is a mere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passe-temps</i> in vine-growing
regions, here it has become the chief
resource of the population.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Even at Romorantin
itself, where 400 women and girls are
employed in one factory, there are more than
1,000 women who sew linen in their houses.</p>

<p>The same must be said of a group of industrial
villages peopled with clothiers in the neighbourhood
of another Normandy city, Elbœuf.
When Baudrillart visited them in 1878-1880,
he was struck with the undoubted advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
offered by a combination of agriculture with
industry. Clean houses, clean dresses, and a
general stamp of well-being were characteristic
of these villages.</p>

<p>Happily enough, weaving is not the only
small industry of both this region and Brittany.
On the contrary, scores of other small
industries enliven the villages and burgs. At
Fougères (in Ille-et-Vilaine, to the north-east
of Reims) one sees how the factory has contributed
to the development of various small
and domestic trades. In 1830 this town was a
great centre for the domestic fabrication of the
so-called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaussons de tresse</i>. The competition
of the prisons killed, however, this primitive
industry; but it was soon substituted by the
fabrication of soft socks in felt (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaussons de
feutre</i>). This last industry also went down,
and then the fabrication of boots and shoes
was introduced, this last giving origin, in its
turn, to the boot and shoe factories, of which
there are now thirty-three at Fougères, employing
8,000 workers<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> (yearly production about
5,000,000 pairs). But at the same time
domestic industries took a new development.
Thousands of women are employed now in their
houses in sewing the “uppers” and in embroidering
fancy shoes. Moreover, quite a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
number of smaller workshops grew up in the
neighbourhood, for the fabrication of cardboard
boxes, wooden heels, and so on, as well
as a number of tanneries, big and small. And
M. Ardouin Dumazet’s remark is, that one is
struck to find, owing to these industries, an
undoubtedly higher level of well-being in the
villages&mdash;quite unforeseen in the centre of this
purely agricultural region.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>In Brittany, in the neighbourhood of Quimperlé,
a great number of small workshops for
the fabrication of the felt hats which are worn
by the peasants is scattered in the villages;
and rapidly improving agriculture goes hand
in hand with that trade. Well-being is a distinctive
feature of these villages.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> At Hennebont
(on the southern coast of Brittany) 1,400
workers are employed in an immense factory
in the fabrication of tins for preserves, and
every year twenty-two to twenty-three tons of
iron are transformed into steel, and next into
tins, which are sent to Paris, Bordeaux, Nantes,
and so on. But the factory has created “quite
a world of tiny workshops” in this purely
agricultural region: small tin-ware workshops,
tanneries, potteries, and so on, while the slags
are transformed in small factories into manure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span></p>

<p>Agriculture and industry are thus going here
hand in hand, the importance of not severing
the union being perhaps best seen at Loudéac,
a small town in the midst of Brittany (department
of Côtes-du-Nord). Formerly the villages
in this neighbourhood were industrial, all hamlets
being peopled with weavers who fabricated
the well-known Brittany linen. Now, this industry
having gone down very much, the
weavers have simply returned to the soil. Out
of an industrial town, Loudéac has become
an agricultural market town;<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and, what is
most interesting, these populations conquer
new lands for agriculture and turn the formerly
quite unproductive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">landes</i> into rich corn fields;
while on the northern coast of Brittany, around
Dol, on land which began to be conquered from
the sea in the twelfth century, market-gardening
is now carried on to a very great extent for
export to England.</p>

<p>Altogether, it is striking to observe, on
perusing M. Ardouin Dumazet’s little volumes,
how domestic industries go hand in hand with
all sorts of small industries in agriculture&mdash;gardening,
poultry-farming, fabrication of fruit
preserves, and so on&mdash;and how all sorts of associations
for sale and export are easily introduced.
Mans is, as known, a great centre for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
the export of geese and all sorts of poultry to
England.</p>

<p>Part of Normandy (namely, the departments
of Eure and Orne) is dotted with small workshops
where all sorts of small brass goods and
hardware are fabricated in the villages. Of
course, the domestic fabrication of pins is
nearly gone, and as for needles, polishing only,
in a very primitive form, has been maintained
in the villages. But all sorts of small hardware,
including nails, lockets, etc., in great variety,
are fabricated in the villages, especially round
Laigle. Stays are also sewn in small workshops
in many villages, notwithstanding the competition
of prison work.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Tinchebrai (to the west of Flers) is a real
centre for a great variety of smaller goods in
iron, mother-of-pearl and horn. All sorts of
hardware and locks are fabricated by the
peasants during the time they can spare from
agriculture, and real works of art, some of which
were much admired at the exhibition of 1889,
are produced by these humble peasant sculptors
in horn, mother-of-pearl and iron. Farther
south, the polishing of marble goods is carried
on in numbers of small workshops, scattered
round Solesmes and grouped round one central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
establishment where marble pieces are roughly
shaped with the aid of steam, to be finished
in the small village workshops. At Sablé the
workers in that branch, who all own their
houses and gardens, enjoy a real well-being
especially noticed by our traveller.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>In the woody regions of the Perche and the
Maine we find all sorts of wooden industries
which evidently could only be maintained
owing to the communal possession of the
woods. Near the forest of Perseigne there
is a small burg, Fresnaye, which is entirely
peopled with workers in wood.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“There is not one house,” Ardouin Dumazet writes, “in
which wooden goods would not be fabricated. Some years ago
there was little variety in their produce; spoons, salt-boxes,
shepherds’ boxes, scales, various wooden pieces for weavers,
flutes and hautboys, spindles, wooden measures, funnels, and
wooden bowls were only made. But Paris wanted to have a
thousand things in which wood was combined with iron:
mouse-traps, cloak-pegs, spoons for jam, brooms.... And
now every house has a workshop containing either a turning-lathe,
or some machine-tools for chopping wood, for making
lattice-work, and so on.... Quite a new industry was born,
and the most coquettish things are now fabricated. Owing to
this industry the population is happy. The earnings are not
high, but each worker owns his house and garden, and occasionally
a bit of field.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>
</div>

<p>At Neufchâtel wooden shoes are made, and
the hamlet, we are told, has a most smiling
aspect. To every house a garden is attached,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
and none of the misery of big cities is to be seen.
At Jupilles and in the surrounding country other
varieties of wooden goods are produced: taps,
boxes of different kinds, together with wooden
shoes; while at the forest of Vibraye two
workshops have been erected for turning out
umbrella handles by the million for all France.
One of these workshops having been founded
by a worker sculptor, he has invented and
introduced in his workshop the most ingenious
machine-tools. About 150 men work at this
factory; but it is evident that half a dozen
smaller workshops, scattered in the villages,
would have answered equally well.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Going now over to a quite different region&mdash;the
Nièvre, in the centre of France, and Haute
Marne, in the east&mdash;we find that both regions
are great centres for a variety of small industries,
some of which are maintained by
associations of workers, while others have
grown up in the shadow of factories. The
small iron workshops which formerly covered
the country have not disappeared: they have
undergone a transformation; and now the
country is covered with small workshops where
agricultural machinery, chemical produce, and
pottery are fabricated; “one ought to go as
far as Guérigny and Fourchambault to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
the great industry;”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> while a number of
small workshops for the fabrication of a variety
of hardware flourish by the side of, and owing
to the proximity of, the industrial centres.</p>

<p>Pottery makes the fortune of the valley of the
Loire about Nevers. High-class art pottery is
made in this town, while in the villages plain
pottery is fabricated and exported by merchants
who go about with their boats selling it.
At Gien a large factory of china buttons (made
out of felspar-powder cemented with milk) has
lately been established, and employs 1,500 workmen,
who produce from 3,500 to 4,500 lb. of
buttons every day. And, as is often the case,
part of the work is done in the villages. For
many miles on both banks of the Loire, in all
villages, old people, women and children sew
the buttons to the cardboard pieces. Of course,
that sort of work is wretchedly paid; but it is
resorted to only because there is no other sort
of industry in the neighbourhood to which the
peasants could give their leisure time.</p>

<p>In the same region of the Haute Marne,
especially in the neighbourhood of Nogent, we
find cutlery as a by-occupation to agriculture.
Landed property is very much subdivided in
that part of France, and great numbers of
peasants own but from two to three acres per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
family, or even less. Consequently, in thirty
villages round Nogent, about 5,000 men are
engaged in cutlery, chiefly of the highest sort
(artistic knives are occasionally sold at as
much as £20 a piece), while the lower sorts are
fabricated in the neighbourhoods of Thiers, in
Puy-de-Dôme (Auvergne). The Nogent industry
has developed spontaneously, with no aid
from without, and in its technical part it shows
considerable progress.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> At Thiers, where the
cheapest sorts of cutlery are made, the division
of labour, the cheapness of rent for small
workshops supplied with motive power from the
Durolle river, or from small gas motors, the aid
of a great variety of specially invented machine-tools,
and the existing combination of machine-work
with hand-work have resulted in such a
perfection of the technical part of the trade
that it is considered doubtful whether the
factory system could further economise labour.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
For twelve miles round Thiers, in each direction,
all the streamlets are dotted with small workshops,
in which peasants, who continue to
cultivate their fields, are at work.</p>

<p>Basket-making is again an important cottage
industry in several parts of France, namely in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
Aisne and in Haute Marne. In this last department,
at Villaines, everyone is a basket-maker,
“and all the basket-makers belong to a
co-operative society,” Ardouin Dumazet remarks.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
“There are no employers; all the
produce is brought once a fortnight to the co-operative
stores and there it is sold for the association.
About 150 families belong to it, and each
owns a house and some vineyards.” At Fays-Billot,
also in Haute Marne, 1,500 basket-makers
belong to an association; while at Thiérache,
where several thousand men are engaged in the
same trade, no association has been formed, the
earnings being in consequence extremely low.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another very important centre of petty
trades is the French Jura, or the French part
of the Jura Mountains, where the watch trade
has attained, as known, a high development.
When I visited these villages between the
Swiss frontier and Besançon in the year 1878,
I was struck by the high degree of relative
well-being which I could observe, even though
I was perfectly well acquainted with the Swiss
villages in the Val de Saint Imier. It is very
probable that the machine-made watches have
brought about a crisis in French watch-making
as they have in Switzerland. But it is known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
that part, at least, of the Swiss watch-makers
have strenuously fought against the necessity
of being enrolled in the factories, and that
while watch factories grew up at Geneva and
elsewhere, considerable numbers of the watch-makers
have taken to divers other trades which
continue to be carried on as domestic or small
industries. I must only add that in the French
Jura great numbers of watch-makers were at
the same time owners of their houses and
gardens, very often of bits of fields, and
especially of communal meadows, and that the
communal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fruitières</i>, or creameries, for the
common sale of butter and cheese, are widely
spread in that part of France.</p>

<p>So far as I could ascertain, the development
of the machine-made watch industry has not
destroyed the small industries of the Jura hills.
The watch-makers have taken to new branches,
and, as in Switzerland, they have created
various new industries. From Ardouin Dumazet’s
travels we can, at anyrate, borrow an
insight into the present state of the southern
part of this region. In the neighbourhoods of
Nantua and Cluses silks are woven in nearly all
villages, the peasants giving to weaving their
spare time from agriculture, while quite a
number of small workshops (mostly less than
twenty looms, one of 100 looms) are scattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
in the little villages, on the streamlets running
from the hills. Scores of small saw-mills have
also been built along the streamlet Merloz, for
the fabrication of all sorts of little pretty things
in wood. At Oyonnax, a small town on the
Ain, we have a big centre for the fabrication of
combs, an industry more than 200 years old,
which took a new development since the last
war through the invention of celluloid. No
less than 100 or 120 “masters” employ from
two to fifteen workers each, while over 1,200
persons work in their houses, making combs
out of Irish horn and French celluloid. Wheel-power
was formerly rented in small workshops,
but electricity, generated by a waterfall, has
lately been introduced, and is now distributed
in the houses for bringing into motion small
motors of from one-quarter to twelve horse-power.
And it is remarkable to notice that as
soon as electricity gave the possibility to return
to domestic work, 300 workers left at once the
small workshops and took to work in their
houses. Most of these workers have their
own cottages and gardens, and they show a
very interesting spirit of association. They
have also erected four workshops for making
cardboard boxes, and their production is valued
at 2,000,000 fr. every year.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span></p>

<p>At St. Claude, which is a great centre for
briar pipes (sold in large quantities in London
with English trade-marks, and therefore eagerly
bought by those Frenchmen who visit London,
as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souvenir</i> from the other side of the Channel),
both big and small workshops, supplied by
motive force from the Tacon streamlet, prosper
by the side of each other. Over 4,000 men and
women are employed in this trade, while all
sorts of small by-trades have grown by its
side (amber and horn mouth-pieces, sheaths,
etc.). Countless small workshops are busy
besides, on the banks of the two streams, with
the fabrication of all sorts of wooden things:
match-boxes, beads, sheaths for spectacles,
small things in horn, and so on, to say nothing
of a rather large factory (200 workers) where
metric measures are fabricated for the whole
world. At the same time thousands of persons
in St. Claude, in the neighbouring villages and
in the smallest mountain hamlets, are busy in
cutting diamonds (an industry only fifteen
years old in this region), and other thousands
are busy in cutting various less precious stones.
All this is done in quite small workshops supplied
by water-power.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span></p>

<p>The extraction of ice from some lakes and the
gathering of oak-bark for tanneries complete
the picture of these busy villages, where industry
joins hands with agriculture, and modern
machines and appliances are so well put in the
service of the small workshops.</p>

<p>On the other side, at Besançon, which was,
in 1878, when I visited it, a great centre
for watch-making, “all taken, nothing has yet
been changed in the habits of the working-class,”
M. Dumazet wrote in 1901. The
watch-makers continued to work in their
houses or in small workshops.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Only there
was no complete fabrication of the watch or
the clock. Many important parts&mdash;the wheels,
etc.&mdash;were imported from Switzerland or from
different towns of France. And, as is always
the case, numerous small secondary workshops
for making the watch-cases, the hands, and so
on, grew up in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The same has to be said of Montbéliard&mdash;another
important centre of the watch trade.
By the side of the manufactures, where all the
parts of the mechanism of the watch are fabricated
by machinery, there is quite a number
of workshops where various parts of the watch
are made by skilled workmen; and this industry
has already given birth to a new branch&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
making of various tools for these workshops,
as also for different other trades.</p>

<p>In other parts of the same region, such as
Héricourt, a variety of small industries has
grown by the side of the great ironmongery
factories. The city spreads into the villages,
where the population are making coffee-mills,
spice-mills, machines for crushing the grain for
the cattle, as well as saddlery, small ironmongery,
or even watches. Elsewhere the
fabrication of different small parts of the watch
having been monopolised by the factories, the
workshops began to manufacture the small parts
of the bicycles, and later on of the motor-cars.
In short, we have here quite a world of industries
of modern origin, and with them of inventions
made to simplify the work of the hand.</p>

<p>Finally, omitting a mass of small trades, I
will only name the hat-makers of the Loire, the
stationery of the Ardèche, the fabrication of
hardware in the Doubs, the glove-makers of
the Isère, the broom and brush-makers of the
Oise (valued at £800,000 per annum), and the
house machine-knitting in the neighbourhoods
of Troyes. But I must say a few words more
about two important centres of small industries:
the Lyons region and Paris.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the present time the industrial region of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
which Lyons is the centre<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> includes the departments
of Rhône, Loire, Drôme, Saône-et-Loire,
Ain, the southern part of the Jura department,
and the western part of Savoy, as
far as Annecy, while the silkworm is reared
as far as the Alps, the Cévennes Mountains,
and the neighbourhoods of Mâcon. It contains,
besides fertile plains, large hilly tracks,
also very fertile as a rule, but covered with
snow during part of the winter, and the rural
populations are therefore bound to resort to
some industrial occupation in addition to
agriculture; they find it in silk-weaving and
various small industries. Altogether it may be
said that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">région lyonnaise</i> is characterised
as a separate centre of French civilisation
and art, and that a remarkable spirit of research,
discovery and invention has developed
there in all directions&mdash;scientific and industrial.</p>

<p>The Croix Rousse at Lyons, where the silk-weavers
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canuts</i>) have their chief quarters, is
the centre of that industry, and in 1895 the
whole of that hill, thickly covered with houses,
five, six, eight and ten storeys high, resounded
with the noise of the looms which were busily
going in every department of that big agglomeration.
Electricity has lately been brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
into the service of this domestic industry, supplying
motive power to the looms.</p>

<p>To the south of Lyons, in the city of Vienne,
hand-weaving is disappearing. “Shoddy” is
now the leading produce, and twenty-eight
concerns only remain out of the 120 <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fabriques</i>
which existed thirty years ago. Old woollen
rags, rags of carpets, and all the dust from
the carding and spinning in the wool and
cotton factories of Northern France, with a
small addition of cotton, are transformed here
into cloth which flows from Vienne to all the
big cities of France&mdash;20,000 yards of “shoddy”
every day&mdash;to supply the ready-made clothing
factories. Hand-weaving has evidently nothing
to do in that industry, and in 1890 only 1,300
hand-looms were at work out of the 4,000
which were in motion in 1870. Large factories,
employing a total of 1,800 workers, have taken
the place of these hand-weavers, while “shoddy”
has taken the place of cloth. All sorts of
flannels, felt hats, tissues of horse-hair, and so
on, are fabricated at the same time. But
while the great factory thus conquered the city
of Vienne, its suburbs and its nearest surroundings
became the centre of a prosperous gardening
and fruit culture, which has already been
mentioned in chapter iv.</p>

<p>The banks of the Rhône, between Ampuis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
and Condrieu, are one of the wealthiest parts
of all France, owing to the shrubberies and
nurseries, market-gardening, fruit-growing, vine-growing,
and cheese-making out of goats’ milk.
House industries go there hand in hand with an
intelligent culture of the soil; Condrieu, for
instance, is a famous centre for embroidery,
which is made partly by hand, as of old, and
partly by machinery.</p>

<p>In the west of Lyons, at l’Arbresles, factories
have grown up for making silks and velvets;
but a large part of the population still continue
to weave in their houses; while farther west,
Panissières is the centre of quite a number of
villages in which linen and silks are woven as
a domestic industry. Not all these workers
own their houses, but those, at least, who own or
rent a small piece of land or garden, or keep a
couple of cows, are said to be well off, and the
land, as a rule, is said to be admirably cultivated
by these weavers.</p>

<p>The chief industrial centre of this part of the
Lyons region is certainly Tarare. At the time
when Reybaud wrote his already-mentioned
work, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Coton</cite>, it was a centre for the manufacture
of muslins and it occupied in this industry
the same position as Leeds formerly
occupied in this country in the woollen cloth
trade. The spinning mills and the large finish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>ing
factories were at Tarare, while the weaving
of the muslins and the embroidery of the same
were made in the surrounding villages, especially
in the hilly tracts of the Beaujolais
and the Forez. Each peasant house, each
farm and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métayerie</i> were small workshops at
that time, and one could see, Reybaud wrote,
the lad of twenty embroidering fine muslin
after he had finished cleaning the farm stables,
without the work suffering in its delicacy from
a combination of two such varied pursuits. On
the contrary, the delicacy of the work and the
extreme variety of patterns were a distinctive
feature of the Tarare muslins and a cause of
their success. All testimonies agreed at the
same time in recognising that, while agriculture
found support in the industry, the agricultural
population enjoyed a relative well-being.</p>

<p>By this time the industry has undergone a
thorough transformation, but still no less than
60,000 persons, representing a population of
about 250,000 souls, work for Tarare in the
hilly tracts, weaving all sorts of muslins for all
parts of the world, and they earn every year
£480,000 in this way.</p>

<p>Amplepuis, notwithstanding its own factories
of silks and blankets, remains one of the local
centres for such muslins; while close by, Thizy
is a centre for a variety of linings, flannels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
“peruvian serges,” “oxfords,” and other mixed
woollen-and-cotton stuffs which are woven in
the mountains by the peasants. No less than
3,000 hand-looms are thus scattered in twenty-two
villages, and about £600,000 worth of
various stuffs are woven every year by the rural
weavers in this neighbourhood alone; while
15,000 power-looms are at work in both Thizy
and the great city of Roanne, in which two
towns all varieties of cottons (linings, flannelettes,
apron cloth) and silk blankets are woven in
factories by the million yards.</p>

<p>At Cours, 1,600 workers are employed in
making “blankets,” chiefly of the lowest sort
(even such as are sold at 2s. and even 10d. a
piece, for export to Brazil); all possible and
imaginable rags and sweepings from all sorts
of textile factories (jute, cotton, flax, hemp,
wool and silk) are used for that industry, in
which the factory is, of course, fully victorious.
But even at Roanne, where the fabrication
of cottons has attained a great degree of perfection
and 9,000 power-looms are at work,
producing every year more than 30,000,000
yards&mdash;even at Roanne one finds with astonishment
that domestic industries are not dead,
but yield every year the respectable amount
of more than 10,000,000 yards of stuffs. At
the same time, in the neighbourhood of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
big city the industry of fancy-knitting has taken
within the last thirty years a sudden development.
Only 2,000 women were employed in it
in 1864, but their numbers were estimated by
M. Dumazet at 20,000; and, without abandoning
their rural work, they find time to knit,
with the aid of small knitting-machines, all
sorts of fancy articles in wool, the annual
value of which, attains £360,000.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>It must not be thought, however, that textiles
and connected trades are the only small
industries in this locality. Scores of various
rural industries continue to exist besides, and
in nearly all of them the methods of production
are continually improved. Thus, when the
rural making of plain chairs became unprofitable,
articles of luxury and stylish chairs began to be
fabricated in the villages, and similar transformations
are found everywhere.</p>

<p>More details about this extremely interesting
region will be found in the Appendix, but one
remark must be made in this place. Notwithstanding
its big industries and coal mines, this
part of France has entirely maintained its rural
aspect, and is now one of the best cultivated
parts of the country. What most deserves
admiration is&mdash;not so much the development
of the great industries, which, after all, here as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
elsewhere, are to a great extent international
in their origins&mdash;as the creative and inventive
powers and capacities of adaptation which
appear amongst the great mass of these industrious
populations. At every step, in the
field, in the garden, in the orchard, in the
dairy, in the industrial arts, in the hundreds
of small inventions in these arts, one sees the
creative genius of the folk. In these regions
one best understands why France, taking the
mass of its population, is considered the richest
country of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The chief centre for petty trades in France is,
however, Paris. There we find, by the side of
the large factories, the greatest variety of
petty trades for the fabrication of goods of
every description, both for the home market
and for export. The petty trades at Paris so
much prevail over the factories that the average
number of workmen employed in the 98,000
factories and workshops of Paris is less than
<em>six</em>, while the number of persons employed in
workshops which have less than five operatives
is almost twice as big as the number of persons
employed in the larger establishments.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
fact, Paris is a great bee-hive where hundreds
of thousands of men and women fabricate in
small workshops all possible varieties of goods
which require skill, taste and invention. These
small workshops, in which artistic finish and
rapidity of work are so much praised, necessarily
stimulate the mental powers of the
producers; and we may safely admit that if
the Paris workmen are generally considered,
and really are, more developed intellectually
than the workers of any other European capital,
this is due to a great extent to the character
of the work they are engaged in&mdash;a work
which implies artistic taste, skill, and especially
inventiveness, always wide awake in order
to invent new patterns of goods and steadily
to increase and to perfect the technical methods
of production. It also appears very probable
that if we find a highly developed working
population in Vienna and Warsaw, this depends
again to a very great extent upon the very
considerable development of similar small
industries, which stimulate invention and so
much contribute to develop the worker’s intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Galerie du travail</i> at the Paris exhibitions
is always a most remarkable sight. One can
appreciate in it both the variety of the small
industries which are carried on in French
towns and the skill and inventing powers of the
workers. And the question necessarily arises:
Must all this skill, all this intelligence, be swept
away by the factory, instead of becoming a
new fertile source of progress under a better
organisation of production? must all this
independence and inventiveness of the worker
disappear before the factory levelling? and,
if it must, would such a transformation be a
progress, as so many economists who have
only studied figures and not human beings
are ready to maintain?</p>

<p>At anyrate, it is quite certain that even if the
absorption of the French petty trades by the
big factories were possible&mdash;which seems extremely
doubtful&mdash;the absorption would not be
accomplished so soon as that. The small industry
of Paris fights hard for its maintenance,
and it shows its vitality by the numberless
machine-tools which are continually invented by
the workers for improving and cheapening the
produce.</p>

<p>The numbers of motors which were exhibited
at the last exhibitions in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Galerie du travail</i>
bear a testimony to the fact that a cheap motor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
for the small industry, is one of the leading
problems of the day. Motors weighing only
forty-five lb., including the boiler, were exhibited
in 1889 to answer that want. Small two-horse-power
engines, fabricated by the engineers of
the Jura (formerly watch-makers) in their small
workshops, were at that time another attempt
to solve the problem&mdash;to say nothing of the
water, gas and electrical motors.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The transmission
of steam-power to 230 small workshops
which was made by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Société des Immeubles
industriels</i> was another attempt in the same
direction, and the increasing efforts of the French
engineers for finding out the best means of
transmitting and subdividing power by means
of compressed air, “tele-dynamic cables,” and
electricity are indicative of the endeavours of
the small industry to retain its ground in the
face of the competition of the factories. (See
Appendix V.)</p>

<p>Such are the small industries in France, as
they have been described by observers who saw
them on the spot. Is is, however, most interesting
to have exact statistical items concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
the extension of the small industries, and to
know their importance, in comparison with the
great industry. Fortunately enough, a general
census of the French industries was made in the
year 1896; its results have been published in full,
under the title of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Résultats statistiques du recensement
des industries et des professions</cite>, and in the
fourth volume of this capital work we find
an excellent summing up of the main results
of the census, written by M. Lucien March. I
give a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">résumé</i> of these results in the Appendix,
as otherwise I should have been compelled, in
speaking of the distribution of great and small
industry in France, to repeat very much what I
have said in this same chapter, speaking of the
United Kingdom. There is so much in common
in the distribution of small and large factories
in the different branches of industry in both
countries that it would have been a tedious
repetition. So I give here only the main items
and refer the reader to Appendix W.</p>

<p>The general distribution of the workers’
population in large, middle-sized, and small
factories in the year 1896 was as follows. First
of all there was the great division of independent
artisans who worked single-handed, and working
men and women who were without permanent
employment on the day of the census. Part of
this large division belongs to agriculture; but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
after having deducted the agricultural establishments,
M. March arrives at the figures of 483,000
establishments belonging to this category in
industry, and 1,047,000 persons of both sexes
working in these establishments, or temporarily
attached to some industrial establishment. To
these we must add 37,705 industrial establishments,
where no hired workmen are employed,
but the head of the establishment works with
the aid of the members of his own family. We
have thus, in these two divisions, about 520,700
establishments and 1,084,700 persons which I
inscribe in the following table under the head of
“No hired operatives.” The table then appears
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">These figures speak for themselves and show
what an immense importance the small industry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
has in France. More details, showing the distribution
of the great, middle-sized and small
industry in different branches will be found in
the Appendix, and there the reader will also see
what a striking resemblance is offered under this
aspect by the industry of France and that of the
United Kingdom. In the next chapter it will
be seen from a similar census that Germany
stands in absolutely the same position.</p>

<p>It would have been very interesting to compare
the present distribution of industries in France
with what it was previously. But M. Lucien
March tells us that “<em>no statistics previous to
1896 have given us a knowledge of that distribution</em>.”
Still, an inquest made between 1840 and
1845, and which M. March considers “very
complete for the more important establishments
which employed more than fifty workmen,” was
worked out by him, and he found that such
establishments numbered 3,300 in 1840; in
1896 they had already attained the number of
7,400, and they occupied more than fifty-five per
cent. of all the workpeople employed in industry.
As to the establishments which employed more
than 500 persons and which numbered 133 in
1840 (six per cent. of all the workpeople), they
attained the number of 444 in 1896, and sixteen
per cent. of all the workpeople were employed in
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span></p>

<p>The conclusion to be drawn from these facts
is thus worded by M. March: “To sum up, during
the last fifty years a notable concentration
of the factories took place in the big establishments;
but the just-mentioned results, supported
by the statistics of the patents, permit us
to recognise that <em>this concentration does not
prevent the maintenance of a mass of small
enterprises, the average sizes of which increase
but very slowly</em>.” This last is, in fact, what we
have just seen from our brief sketch for the
United Kingdom, and we can only ask ourselves
whether&mdash;such being the facts&mdash;the word “concentration”
is well chosen. What we see in
reality is, the appearance, <em>in some branches of
industry</em>, of a certain number of large establishments,
and especially of middle-sized factories.
But this does not prevent in the least that very
great numbers of small factories should continue
to exist, either in other branches, or in the very
same branches where large factories have appeared
(the textiles, work in metal), or in branches
connected with the main ones, which take their
origin in these main ones, as the industry of
clothing takes its origin from that of the textiles.</p>

<p>This is the only conclusion which a serious
analysis permits us to draw from the facts
brought to light by the census of 1896 and subsequent
observations. As to the large deduc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>tions
about “concentration” made by certain
economists, they are mere <em>hypotheses</em>&mdash;useful, of
course, for stimulating research, but becoming
quite noxious when they are represented <em>as
economical laws</em>, when in reality they are not
confirmed at all by the testimony of carefully
observed facts.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129" class="label">[129]</a> This is why the German economists find such difficulties
in delimiting the proper domain of the domestic trades
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hausindustrie</i>), and now identify this word with <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Verlagssystem</i>,
which means “working either directly or through the intermediary
of a middleman employer (or buyer) for a dealer or
employer, who pays the small producer for the goods he has
produced, before they have reached the consumer.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_131" href="#FNanchor_131" class="label">[131]</a> The Chief Inspector, Mr. Whitelegge, wrote to me in 1900
that the workshops which did not enter into his reports
represented about one-half of all the workshops. Since that
time Mr. Whitelegge has continued to publish his interesting
reports, adding to them new groups of workshops. However,
they still remain incomplete to some extent as regards this last
point. In the last Report, published in 1911, we see that
147,000 workshops were registered at the end of 1907, and
returns were received from 105,000 of them. But as in 32,000
workshops no women or young persons (below 18) were employed,
their returns were not published. The Report for
1907 gives, therefore, only 91,249 workshops in which 638,335
persons were employed (186,064 male and 282,324 female
adults, 54,605 male and 113,728 female young persons&mdash;that is,

<p><em>Petty trades in Germany</em>: Discussions upon the subject and

</div>


<h3><em>Petty Trades in Germany.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The various industries which still have
retained in Germany the characters of
petty and domestic trades have been the subject
of many exhaustive explorations, especially
by A. M. Thun and Prof. Issaieff, on behalf
of the Russian Petty Trades Commission,
Emanuel Hans Sax, Paul Voigt, and very
many others. By this time the subject has a
bulky literature, and such impressive and
suggestive pictures have been drawn from
life for different regions and trades that I felt
tempted to sum up these life-true descriptions.
However, as in such a summary I
should have to repeat much of what has already
been said and illustrated in the preceding chap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>ter,
it will probably more interest the general
reader to know something about the conclusions
which can be drawn from the works
of the German investigators,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and to know
the conclusions that may be drawn from the
three censuses of industries which have been
made in Germany in the years 1882, 1895, and
1907. This is what I am going to do.</p>

<p>Unhappily, the discussion upon this important
subject has often taken in Germany a passionate
and even a personally aggressive character.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
On the one hand the ultra-conservative elements
of German politics tried, and succeeded
to some extent, in making of the petty trades
and the domestic industries an arm for securing
a return to the “olden good times.” They
even passed a law intended to prepare a re-introduction
of the old-fashioned, closed and
patriarchal corporations which could be placed
under the close supervision and tutorship of
the State, and they saw in such a law a weapon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
against social democracy. On the other hand,
the social democrats, justly opposed to such
measures, but themselves inclined, in their turn,
to take too abstract a view of economical questions,
bitterly attack all those who do not
merely repeat the stereotyped phrases to the
effect that “the petty trades are in decay,”
and “the sooner they disappear the better,”
as they will give room to capitalist centralisation,
which, according to the social democratic
creed, “will soon achieve its own ruin.” In
this dislike of the small industries they are,
of course, at one with the economists of the
orthodox school, whom they combat on nearly
all other points.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span></p>

<p>Under such conditions, the polemics about
the petty trades and the domestic industries are
evidently doomed to remain most unproductive.
However, it is pleasant to see that a considerable
amount of most conscientious work has
been made for the investigation of the petty
trades in Germany; and, by the side of such
monographs, from which nothing can be
learned but that the petty trades’ workers
are in a miserable condition, and nothing
whatever can be gathered to explain why these
workers prefer their conditions to those of
factory hands&mdash;there is no lack of very detailed
monographs (such as those of Thun,
Em. H. Sax, Paul Voigt on the Berlin cabinet-makers,
etc.), in which one sees the whole of
the life of these classes of workers, the difficulties
which they have to cope with, and the
technical conditions of the trade, and finds all
the elements for an independent judgment
upon the matter.</p>

<p>It is evident that a number of petty trades are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
already now doomed to disappear; but there
are others, on the contrary, which are endowed
with a great vitality, and all chances are in
favour of their continuing to exist and to
take a further development for many years to
come. In the fabrication of such textiles as
are woven by millions of yards, and can be best
produced with the aid of a complicated machinery,
the competition of the hand-loom against
the power-loom is evidently nothing but a
survival, which may be maintained for some
time by certain local conditions, but finally
must die away.</p>

<p>The same is true with regard to many branches
of the iron industries, hardware fabrication,
pottery, and so on. But wherever the direct
intervention of taste and inventiveness are
required, wherever new patterns of goods
requiring a continual renewal of machinery and
tools must continually be introduced in order
to feed the demand, as is the case with all fancy
textiles, even though they be fabricated to
supply the millions; wherever a great variety of
goods and the uninterrupted invention of new
ones goes on, as is the case in the toy trade,
in instrument making, watch-making, bicycle
making, and so on; and finally, wherever the
artistic feeling of the individual worker makes
the best part of his goods, as is the case in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
hundreds of branches of small articles of luxury,
there is a wide field for petty trades, rural
workshops, domestic industries, and the like.
More fresh air, more ideas, more general conceptions,
and more co-operation are evidently
required in those industries. But where the
spirit of initiative has been awakened in one
way or another, we see the petty industries
taking a new development in Germany, as we
have just seen that being done in France.</p>

<p>Now, in nearly all the petty trades in Germany,
the position of the workers is unanimously
described as most miserable, and the
many admirers of centralisation which we find
in Germany always insist upon this misery
in order to predict, and to call for, the disappearance
of “those mediæval survivals”
which “capitalist centralisation” must supplant
for the benefit of the worker. The reality is,
however, that when we compare the miserable
conditions of the workers in the petty trades
with the conditions of the wage workers in
the factories, in the same regions and in the
same trades, we see that the very same misery
prevails among the factory workers. They
live upon wages of from nine to eleven shillings
a week, in town slums instead of the country.
They work eleven hours a day, and they also
are subject to the extra misery thrown upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
them during the frequently recurring crises.
It is only after they have undergone all sorts
of sufferings in their struggles against their
employers that some factory workers succeed,
more or less, here and there, to wrest from
their employers a “living wage”&mdash;and this
again only in certain trades.</p>

<p>To welcome all these sufferings, seeing in
them the action of a “natural law” and a
<em>necessary</em> step towards the <em>necessary</em> concentration
of industry, would be simply absurd.
While to maintain that the pauperisation of all
workers and the wreckage of all village industries
are a <em>necessary</em> step towards a higher form
of industrial organisation would be, not only to
affirm much more than one is entitled to affirm
under the present imperfect state of economical
knowledge, but to show an absolute want of
comprehension of the sense of both natural and
economic laws. Everyone, on the contrary,
who has studied the question of the growth of
great industries on its own merits, will undoubtedly
agree with Thorold Rogers, who
considered the sufferings inflicted upon the
labouring classes for that purpose as having
been of <em>no necessity whatever</em>, and simply having
been inflicted to suit the temporary interests of
the few&mdash;by no means those of the nation.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span></p>

<p>Moreover, everyone knows to what extent
the labour of children and girls is resorted to,
even in the most prosperous factories&mdash;even in
this country which stands foremost in industrial
development. Some figures relative to this
subject were given in the preceding chapter.
And this fact is not an accident which might
be easily removed, as Maurice Block&mdash;a great
admirer, of course, of the factory system&mdash;tries
to represent it.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The low wages paid to
children and youths are now one of the <em>necessary</em>
elements in the cheapness of the factory
produced textiles, and, consequently, of the
very competition of the factory with the petty
trades. I have mentioned besides, whilst speaking
of France, what are the effects of “concentrated”
industries upon village life; and in
Thun’s work, and in many others as well, one
may find enough of ghastly instances of what
are the effects of accumulations of girls in the
factories. To idealise the modern factory, in
order to depreciate the so-called “mediæval”
forms of the small industries, is consequently&mdash;to
say the least&mdash;as unreasonable as to idealise
the latter and try to bring mankind back to
isolated home-spinning and home-weaving in
every peasant house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span></p>

<p>One fact dominates all the investigations
which have been made into the conditions of the
small industries. We find it in Germany, as
well as in France or in Russia. In an immense
number of trades it is not the superiority of
the <em>technical</em> organisation of the trade in a
factory, nor the economies realised on the
prime-motor, which militate against the small
industry in favour of the factories, but the
more advantageous conditions for <em>selling</em> the
produce and for <em>buying</em> the raw produce which
are at the disposal of big concerns. Wherever
this difficulty has been overcome, either by
means of association, or in consequence of a
market being secured for the sale of the produce,
it has always been found&mdash;first, that the
conditions of the workers or artisans immediately
improved; and next, that a rapid progress
was realised in the technical aspects of
the respective industries. New processes were
introduced to improve the produce or to increase
the rapidity of its fabrication; new
machine-tools were invented; or new motors
were resorted to; or the trade was reorganised
so as to diminish the costs of production.</p>

<p>On the contrary, wherever the helpless,
isolated artisans and workers continue to remain
at the mercy of the wholesale buyers,
who always&mdash;since Adam Smith’s time&mdash;“openly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
or tacitly” agree to act as one man
to bring down the prices almost to a starvation
level&mdash;and such is the case for the immense
number of the small and village industries&mdash;their
condition is so bad that only the longing
of the workers after a certain relative independence,
and their knowledge of what awaits them
in the factory, prevent them from joining the
ranks of the factory hands. Knowing that in
most cases the advent of the factory would
mean no work at all for most men, and the
taking of the children and girls to the factory,
they do the utmost to prevent it from appearing
at all in the village.</p>

<p>As to combinations in the villages, co-operation
and the like, one must never forget
how jealously the German, the French, the
Russian and the Austrian Governments have
hitherto prevented the workers, <em>and especially
the village workers</em>, from entering into any sort
of combination for economical purposes. In
France the peasant syndicates were permitted
only by the law of 1884. To keep the peasant
at the lowest possible level, by means of taxation,
serfdom, and the like, has been, and is
still, the policy of most continental States. It
was only in 1876 that some extension of the
association rights was granted in Germany,
and even now a mere co-operative association<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
for the sale of the artisans’ work is soon reported
as a “political association” and submitted
as such to the usual limitations, such as
the exclusion of women and the like.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> A striking
example of that policy as regards a village
association was given by Prof. Issaieff, who
also mentioned the severe measures taken by
the wholesale buyers in the toy trade to prevent
the workers from entering into direct intercourse
with foreign buyers.</p>

<p>When one examines with more than a superficial
attention the life of the small industries
and their struggles for life, one sees that when
they perish, they perish&mdash;not because “an
economy can be realised by using a hundred
horse-power motor, instead of a hundred small
motors”&mdash;this inconveniency never fails to
be mentioned, although it is easily obviated in
Sheffield, in Paris, and many other places by
hiring workshops with wheel-power, supplied
by a central machine, and, still more, as was
so truly observed by Prof. W. Unwin, by the
electric transmission of power. They do not
perish because a substantial economy can be
realised in the factory production&mdash;in many more
cases than is usually supposed, the fact is even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
the reverse&mdash;but because the capitalist who
establishes a factory emancipates himself from
the wholesale and retail dealers in raw materials;
and especially, because he emancipates himself
from the buyers of his produce and can deal
directly with the wholesale buyer and exporter;
or else he concentrates in one concern the
different stages of fabrication of a given produce.
The pages which Schulze-Gäwernitz gave
to the organisation of the cotton industry in
England, and to the difficulties which the
German cotton-mill owners had to contend
with, so long as they were dependent upon
Liverpool for raw cotton, are most instructive
in this direction. And what characterises the
cotton trade prevails in all other industries as
well.</p>

<p>If the Sheffield cutlers who now work in
their tiny workshops, in one of the above-mentioned
buildings supplied with wheel-power,
were incorporated in one big factory, the chief
advantage which would be realised in the
factory would <em>not</em> be an economy in the costs
of production, in comparison to the quality
of the produce; with a shareholders’ company
the costs might even increase. And yet the
profits (including wages) probably would be
greater than the aggregate earnings of the
workers, in consequence of the reduced costs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
of purchase of iron and coal, and the facilities
for the sale of the produce. The great concern
would thus find its advantages not in such
factors as are imposed by the <em>technical</em> necessities
of the trade at the time being, but in
such factors as could be eliminated by co-operative
organisation. All these are elementary
notions among practical men.</p>

<p>It hardly need be added that a further advantage
which the factory owner has is, that he can
find a sale even for produce of the most inferior
quality, provided there is a considerable
quantity of it to be sold. All those who are
acquainted with commerce know, indeed, what
an immense bulk of the world’s trade consists
of “shoddy,” <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patraque</i>, “Red Indians’ blankets,”
and the like, shipped to distant countries.
Whole cities&mdash;we just saw&mdash;produce nothing
but “shoddy.”</p>

<p>Altogether, it may be taken as one of the
fundamental facts of the economical life of
Europe that the defeat of a number of small
trades, artisan work and domestic industries,
came through their being incapable of organising
the <em>sale</em> of their produce&mdash;not from the
<em>production</em> itself. The same thing recurs at
every page of economical history. The incapacity
of organising the sale, without being
enslaved by the merchant, was the leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
feature of the Mediæval cities, which gradually
fell under the economical and political yoke
of the Guild-Merchant, <em>simply because they
were not able to maintain the sale of their manufactures
by the community as a whole</em>, or to
organise the sale of a new produce in the interest
of the community. When the markets for such
commodities came to be Asia on the one side,
and the New World on the other side, such
was fatally the case; since commerce had
ceased to be <em>communal</em>, and had become <em>individual</em>,
the cities became a prey for the
rivalries of the chief merchant families.</p>

<p>Even nowadays, when we see the co-operative
societies beginning to succeed in their productive
workshops, while fifty years ago they
invariably failed in their capacity of producers,
we may conclude that the cause of
their previous failures was not in their incapacity
of properly and economically organising
<em>production</em>, but in their inability of acting
as <em>sellers</em> and exporters of the produce they
had fabricated. Their present successes, on
the contrary, are fully accounted for by the
network of distributive societies which they
have at their command. The sale has been
simplified, and production has been rendered
possible <em>by first organising the market</em>.</p>

<p>Such are a few conclusions which may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
drawn from a study of the small industries in
Germany and elsewhere. And it may be
safely said, with regard to Germany, that if
measures are not taken for driving the peasants
from the land on the same scale as they have
been taken in this country; if, on the contrary,
the numbers of small landholders multiply,
they necessarily will turn to various small
trades, in addition to agriculture, as they have
done, and are doing, in France. Every step
that may be taken, either for awakening intellectual
life in the villages, or for assuring the
peasants’ or the country’s rights upon the
land, will necessarily further the growth of
industries in the villages.</p>

<p>In this light it is extremely interesting to
see the figures as to the distribution of the
German industries into a small, middle-sized,
and great industry, which are given by three
industrial censuses taken during the last thirty
years. But for these figures I refer the reader
to the Appendix.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>


<h3><em>Petty Trades in other Countries.</em></h3>

<p>If it were worth extending our inquiry to
other countries, we should find a vast field
for most interesting observations in Switzerland.
There we should see the same vitality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
in a variety of petty industries, and we could
mention what has been done in the different
cantons for maintaining the small trades by
three different sets of measures: the extension
of co-operation; a wide extension of technical
education in the schools and the introduction
of new branches of semi-artistic production in
different parts of the country; and the supply
of cheap motive power in the houses by means of
a hydraulic or an electric transmission of power
borrowed from the waterfalls. A separate
book of the greatest interest and value could
be written on this subject, especially on the
impulse given to a number of petty trades, old
and new, by means of a cheap supply of motive
power. Such a book would also offer a great
interest in that it would show to what an extent
that mingling together of agriculture with
industry, which I described in the first edition
of this book as “the factory amidst the fields,”
has progressed of late in Switzerland. It strikes
at the present time even the casual traveller.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>Belgium would offer an equal interest. Belgium
is certainly a country of centralised
industry, and a country in which the productivity
of the worker stands at a high level,
the average annual productivity of each industrial
workman&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;attaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
now the high figure of at least £250
per head. Coal mines in which more than a
thousand workers are employed are numerous,
and there is a fair number of textile factories
in each of which from 300 to 700 workers are
occupied. And yet, if we exclude from the
industrial workers’ population of Belgium, which
numbered 823,920 persons in 1896 (1,102,240
with the clerks, travellers, supervisors and so
on), the 116,300 workpeople who are employed
in the coal mines, and nearly 165,000 artisans
working single or with the aid of their families,
we find that out of the remaining 565,200
workers very nearly one-half&mdash;that is, 270,200
persons&mdash;work in establishments in which less
than fifty persons are employed, while 95,000
persons out of these last are employed in 54,500
workshops, which thus have an average of less
than three workers per workshop.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> We may
thus say that&mdash;taking the mines out of account&mdash;more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
than one-sixth part of the Belgian
industrial workers are employed in small workshops
which have, on the average, less than three
workers each, besides the master, and that
four-tenths of all the workpeople are employed
in factories and workshops having on
the average less than thirteen workpeople each.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>What is still more remarkable is, that the
number of small workshops, in which from
one to four aids only are employed by the
master, attains the considerable figure of 1,867
(2,293 in 1880) in the textile industries, notwithstanding
the high concentration of a certain
portion<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> of these industries. As to the
machinery works and hardware trades, the
small workshops in which the master works
with from two to four assistants or journeymen
are very numerous (more than 13,300), to say
nothing of the gun trade which is a petty trade
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, and the furniture trade which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
has lately taken a great development. A highly
concentrated industry, and a high productivity,
as well as a considerable export trade, which
all testify to a high industrial development of
the country, thus go hand in hand with a high
development of the domestic trades and small
industries altogether.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It hardly need be said that in Austria, Hungary,
Italy, and even the United States, the
petty trades occupy a prominent position, and
play in the sum total of industrial activity an
even much greater part than in France, Belgium,
or Germany. But it is especially in Russia that
we can fully appreciate the importance of the
rural industries and the terrible sufferings
which will be quite uselessly inflicted on the
population, if the policy of the State is going to
be now the policy advocated by a number of
landlords and factory-owners&mdash;namely, if the
State throws its tremendous weight in favour of
a pauperisation of the peasants and an artificial
annihilation of the rural trades, in order to create
a centralised great industry.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The most exhaustive inquiries into the present
state, the growth, the technical development of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
the rural industries, and the difficulties they have
to contend with, have been made in Russia. A
house-to-house inquiry which embraces nearly
1,000,000 peasants’ houses has been made in
various provinces of Russia, and its results
already represent 450 volumes, printed by
different county councils (<em>Zemstvos</em>). Besides,
in the fifteen volumes published by the Petty
Trades Committee, and still more in the publications
of the Moscow Statistical Committee,
and of many provincial assemblies, we find
exhaustive lists giving the name of each worker,
the extent and the state of his fields, his live
stock, the value of his agricultural and industrial
production, his earnings from both
sources, and his yearly budget; while hundreds
of separate trades have been described in
separate monographs from the technical, economical,
and sanitary points of view.</p>

<p>The results obtained from these inquiries were
really imposing, as it appeared that out of the
80 or 90 million population of European Russia
proper, no less than 7,500,000 persons were
engaged in the domestic trades, and that their
production reached, at the lowest estimate,
more than £150,000,000, and most probably
£200,000,000 (2,000,000,000 roubles) every year.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
It thus exceeded the total production of the
great industry. As to the relative importance
of the two for the working classes suffice it to
say that even in the government of Moscow,
which is the chief manufacturing region of
Russia (its factories yield upwards of one-fifth
in value of the aggregate industrial production
of European Russia), the aggregate incomes
derived by the population from the domestic
industries are three times larger than the
aggregate wages earned in the factories.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of the Russian
domestic trades is that the sudden start which
was made by the factories in Russia did not
prejudice the domestic industries. On the
contrary, it gave a new impulse to their extension;
they grew and developed precisely in
those regions where the factories were growing
up fastest.</p>

<p>Another most suggestive feature is the following:
although the unfertile provinces of
Central Russia have been from time immemorial
the seat of all kinds of petty trades, several
domestic industries of modern origin are de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>veloping
in those provinces which are best
favoured by soil and climate. Thus, the Stavropol
government of North Caucasus, where the
peasantry have plenty of fertile soil, has suddenly
become the seat of a widely developed
silk-weaving industry in the peasants’ houses,
and now it supplies Russia with cheap silks
which have completely expelled from the
market the plain silks formerly imported from
France. In Orenburg and on the Black Sea,
the petty trades’ fabrication of agricultural
machinery, which has grown up lately, is another
instance in point.</p>

<p>The capacities of the Russian domestic industrial
workers for co-operative organisation
would be worthy of more than a passing mention.
As to the cheapness of the produce manufactured
in the villages, which is really astonishing,
it cannot be explained in full by the exceedingly
long hours of labour and the starvation
earnings, because overwork and very low
wages are characteristic of the Russian factories
as well. It depends also upon the circumstance
that the peasant who grows his own
food, but suffers from a constant want of money,
sells the produce of his industrial labour at any
price. Therefore, all manufactured goods used
by the Russian peasantry, save the printed
cottons, are the production of the rural manu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>facturers.
But many articles of luxury, too,
are made in the villages, especially around
Moscow, by peasants who continue to cultivate
their allotments. The silk hats which are sold
in the best Moscow shops, and bear the stamp
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouveautés Parisiennes</i>, are made by the
Moscow peasants; so also the “Vienna” furniture
of the best “Vienna” shops, even if it
goes to supply the palaces. And what is most
to be wondered at is not the skill of the peasants&mdash;agricultural
work is no obstacle to acquiring
industrial skill&mdash;but the rapidity with which
the fabrication of fine goods has spread in such
villages as formerly manufactured only goods
of the roughest description.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>As to the relations between agriculture and
industry, one cannot peruse the documents
accumulated by the Russian statisticians without
coming to the conclusion that, far from
damaging agriculture, the domestic trades, on
the contrary, are the best means for improving
it, and the more so, as for several months every
year the Russian peasant has nothing to do
in the fields. There are regions where agriculture
has been totally abandoned for the
industries; but these are regions where it
was rendered impossible by the very small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
allotments granted to the liberated serfs, the
bad quality or the want of meadows in the
land allotted to the peasants, and by the general
impoverishment of the peasants, following a
very high taxation and very high redemption
taxes for the land. But wherever the allotments
are reasonable and the peasants are less over-taxed,
they continue to cultivate the land, and
their fields are kept in better order; besides,
the average numbers of live stock are higher
where agriculture is carried on in association
with the domestic trades. Even those peasants
whose allotments are small, find the means of
renting more land if they earn some money
from their industrial work. As to the relative
welfare, I need hardly add that it always stands
on the side of those villages which combine
both kinds of work. Vorsma and Pavlovo&mdash;two
cutlery villages, one of which is purely
industrial, while the inhabitants of the other
continue to till the soil&mdash;could be quoted as a
striking instance for such a comparison.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Much more ought to be said with regard to
the rural industries of Russia, especially to
show how easily the peasants associate for buying
new machinery, or for avoiding the middleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
in their purchases of raw produce&mdash;as
soon as misery is no obstacle to the association.
Belgium, and especially Switzerland, could also
be quoted for similar illustrations, but the
above will be enough to give a general idea of
the importance, the vital powers, and the perfectibility
of the rural industries.</p>


<h3><em>Conclusions.</em></h3>

<p>The facts which we have briefly passed in
review show, to some extent, the benefits
which could be derived from a combination of
agriculture with industry, if the latter could
come to the village, not in its present shape of
a capitalist factory, but in the shape of a
socially organised industrial production, with
the full aid of machinery and technical knowledge.
In fact, the most prominent feature of
the petty trades is that a relative well-being
is found only where they are combined with
agriculture: where the workers have remained
in possession of the soil and continue to cultivate
it. Even amidst the weavers of France
or Moscow, who have to reckon with the competition
of the factory, relative well-being prevails
so long as they are not compelled to part
with the soil. On the contrary, as soon as
high taxation or the impoverishment during a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
crisis has compelled the domestic worker to
abandon his last plot of land to the usurer,
misery creeps into his house. The sweater becomes
all-powerful, frightful overwork is resorted
to, and the whole trade often falls into decay.</p>

<p>Such facts, as well as the pronounced tendency
of the factories towards migrating to
the villages, which becomes more and more
apparent nowadays, and found of late its expression
in the ‘Garden Cities’ movement, are
very suggestive. Of course, it would be a
great mistake to imagine that industry ought
to return to its hand-work stage in order to be
combined with agriculture. Whenever a saving
of human labour can be obtained by means of
a machine, the machine is welcome and will be
resorted to; and there is hardly one single
branch of industry into which machinery work
could not be introduced with great advantage,
at least at some of the stages of the manufacture.
In the present chaotic state of industry,
nails and cheap pen-knives can be
made by hand, and plain cottons be woven in
the hand-loom; but such an anomaly will
not last. The machine will supersede hand-work
in the manufacture of plain goods. But
at the same time, handwork very probably
will extend its domain in the artistic finishing
of many things which are now made entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
in the factory; and it will always remain an
important factor in the growth of thousands of
young and new trades.</p>

<p>But the question arises, Why should not the
cottons, the woollen cloth, and the silks, now
woven by hand in the villages, be woven by
machinery in the same villages, without ceasing
to remain connected with work in the
fields? Why should not hundreds of domestic
industries, now carried on entirely by hand,
resort to labour-saving machines, as they
already do in the knitting trade and many
others? There is no reason why the small
motor should not be of a much more general
use than it is now, wherever there is no need
to have a factory; and there is no reason
why the village should not have its small
factory, wherever factory work is preferable,
as we already see it occasionally in certain
villages in France.</p>

<p>More than that. There is no reason why the
factory, with its motive force and machinery,
should not belong to the community, as is
already the case for motive power in the above-mentioned
workshops and small factories in
the French portion of the Jura hills. It is
evident that now, under the capitalist system,
the factory is the curse of the village, as it
comes to overwork children and to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
paupers out of its male inhabitants; and it is
quite natural that it should be opposed by all
means by the workers, if they have succeeded
in maintaining their olden trades’ organisations
(as at Sheffield, or Solingen), or if they have
not yet been reduced to sheer misery (as in the
Jura). But under a more rational social
organisation the factory would find no such
obstacles: it would be a boon to the village.
And there is already unmistakable evidence to
show that a move in this direction <em>is being
made</em> in a few village communities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The moral and physical advantages which
man would derive from dividing his work
between the field and the workshop are self-evident.
But the difficulty is, we are told, in
the necessary centralisation of the modern
industries. In industry, as well as in politics,
centralisation has so many admirers! But in
both spheres the ideal of the centralisers badly
needs revision. In fact, if we analyse the
modern industries, we soon discover that for
some of them the co-operation of hundreds,
or even thousands, of workers gathered at the
same spot is really necessary. The great iron
works and mining enterprises decidedly belong
to that category; oceanic steamers cannot be
built in village factories. But very many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
our big factories are nothing else but agglomerations
under a common management, of several
distinct industries; while others are mere
agglomerations of hundreds of copies of the
very same machine; such are most of our
gigantic spinning and weaving establishments.</p>

<p>The manufacture being a strictly private
enterprise, its owners find it advantageous to
have all the branches of a given industry under
their own management; they thus cumulate
the profits of the successive transformations
of the raw material. And when several thousand
power-looms are combined in one factory,
the owner finds his advantage in being able to
hold the command of the market. But from
a <em>technical</em> point of view the advantages of such
an accumulation are trifling and often doubtful.
Even so centralised an industry as that of the
cottons does not suffer at all from the division
of production of one given sort of goods at
its different stages between several separate
factories: we see it at Manchester and its
neighbouring towns. As to the petty trades, no
inconvenience is experienced from a still greater
subdivision between the workshops in the watch
trade and very many others.</p>

<p>We often hear that one horse-power costs
so much in a small engine, and so much less
in an engine ten times more powerful; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
the pound of cotton yarn costs much less when
the factory doubles the number of its spindles.
But, in the opinion of the best engineering
authorities, such as Prof. W. Unwin, the
hydraulic, and especially the electric, distribution
of power from a central station sets
aside the first part of the argument.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> As to
its second part, calculations of this sort are
only good for those industries which prepare
the half-manufactured produce for further
transformations. As to those countless descriptions
of goods which derive their value
chiefly from the intervention of skilled labour,
they can be best fabricated in smaller factories
which employ a few hundreds, or even a few
scores of operatives. This is why the “concentration”
so much spoken of is often nothing
but an amalgamation of capitalists for the
purpose of <em>dominating the market</em>, not for
cheapening the technical process.</p>

<p>Even under the present conditions the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
leviathan factories offer great inconveniences,
as they cannot rapidly reform their machinery
according to the constantly varying demands
of the consumers. How many failures of great
concerns, too well known in this country to need
to be named, were due to this cause during the
crisis of 1886-1890. As for the new branches
of industry which I have mentioned at the
beginning of the previous chapter, they always
must make a start on a small scale; and they
can prosper in small towns as well as in big
cities, if the smaller agglomerations are provided
with institutions stimulating artistic
taste and the genius of invention. The progress
achieved of late in toy-making, as also the
high perfection attained in the fabrication of
mathematical and optical instruments, of furniture,
of small luxury articles, of pottery and so
on, are instances in point. Art and science are
no longer the monopoly of the great cities, and
further progress will be in scattering them
over the country.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution of industries in
a given country depends, of course, to a great
extent upon a complexus of natural conditions;
it is obvious that there are spots which are
best suited for the development of certain
industries. The banks of the Clyde and the
Tyne are certainly most appropriate for shipbuilding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
yards, and shipbuilding yards must
be surrounded by a variety of workshops and
factories. The industries will always find some
advantages in being grouped, to some extent,
according to the natural features of separate
regions. But we must recognise that now
they are <em>not at all</em> grouped according to those
features. Historical causes&mdash;chiefly religious
wars and national rivalries&mdash;have had a good
deal to do with their growth and their present
distribution; still more so the employers were
guided by considerations as to the facilities
for sale and export&mdash;that is, by considerations
which are already losing their importance with
the increased facilities for transport, and will
lose it still more when the producers produce
for themselves, and not for customers far
away.</p>

<p>Why, in a rationally organised society, ought
London to remain a great centre for the jam
and preserving trade, and manufacture umbrellas
for nearly the whole of the United
Kingdom? Why should the countless Whitechapel
petty trades remain where they are,
instead of being spread all over the country?
There is no reason whatever why the mantles
which are worn by English ladies should be
sewn at Berlin and in Whitechapel, instead of
in Devonshire or Derbyshire. Why should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
Paris refine sugar for almost the whole of
France? Why should one-half of the boots
and shoes used in the United States be manufactured
in the 1,500 workshops of Massachusetts?
There is absolutely no reason why
these and like anomalies should persist. The
industries must be scattered all over the world;
and the scattering of industries amidst all civilised
nations will be necessarily followed by a
further scattering of factories over the territories
of each nation.</p>

<p>In the course of this evolution, the natural
produce of each region and its geographical
conditions certainly will be <em>one</em> of the factors
which will determine the character of the industries
going to develop in this region. But
when we see that Switzerland has become a
great exporter of steam-engines, railway engines,
and steam-boats&mdash;although she has no iron ore
and no coal for obtaining steel, and even has
no seaport to import them; when we see that
Belgium has succeeded in being a great exporter
of grapes, and that Manchester has
managed to become a seaport&mdash;we understand
that in the geographical distribution of industries,
the two factors of local produces and
of an advantageous position by the sea are not
yet the dominant factors. We begin to understand
that, all taken, it is the <em>intellectual</em> factor&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
spirit of invention, the capacity of adaptation,
political liberty, and so on&mdash;which counts
for more than all others.</p>

<p>That all the industries find an advantage in
being carried on in close contact with a great
variety of other industries the reader has seen
already from numerous examples. Every industry
requires <em>technical surroundings</em>. But the
same is also true of agriculture.</p>

<p>Agriculture cannot develop without the aid of
machinery, and the use of a perfect machinery
cannot be generalised without industrial surroundings:
without mechanical workshops,
easily accessible to the cultivator of the soil,
the use of agricultural machinery is not possible.
The village smith would not do. If the work
of a thrashing-machine has to be stopped for a
week or more, because one of the cogs in a
wheel has been broken, and if to obtain a new
wheel one must send a special messenger to the
next province&mdash;then the use of a thrashing-machine
is not possible. But this is precisely
what I saw in my childhood in Central Russia;
and quite lately I have found the very same
fact mentioned in an English autobiography
in the first half of the nineteenth century.
Besides, in all the northern part of the temperate
zone, the cultivators of the soil must
have some sort of industrial employment dur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>ing
the long winter months. This is what has
brought about the great development of rural
industries, of which we have just seen such
interesting examples. But this need is also
felt in the soft climate of the Channel Islands,
notwithstanding the extension taken by
horticulture under glass. “We need such
industries. Could you suggest us any?”
wrote to me one of my correspondents in
Guernsey.</p>

<p>But this is not yet all. Agriculture is so
much in need of aid from those who inhabit
the cities, that every summer thousands of men
leave their slums in the towns and go to the
country for the season of crops. The London
destitutes go in thousands to Kent and Sussex
as hay-makers and hop-pickers, it being estimated
that Kent alone requires 80,000 additional
men and women for hop-picking; whole
villages in France and their cottage industries
are abandoned in the summer, and the peasants
wander to the more fertile parts of the country;
hundreds of thousands of human beings are
transported every summer to the prairies of
Manitoba and Dacota. Every summer many
thousands of Poles spread at harvest time over
the plains of Mecklenburg, Westphalia, and
even France; and in Russia there is every
year an exodus of several millions of men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
journey from the north to the southern prairies
for harvesting the crops; while many St.
Petersburg manufacturers reduce their production
in the summer, because the operatives
return to their native villages for the culture
of their allotments.</p>

<p>Agriculture cannot be carried on without
additional hands in the summer; but it still
more needs temporary aids for <em>improving</em> the
soil, for tenfolding its productive powers.
Steam-digging, drainage, and manuring would
render the heavy clays in the north-west of
London a much richer soil than that of the
American prairies. To become fertile, those
clays want only plain, unskilled human labour,
such as is necessary for digging the soil, laying
in drainage tubes, pulverising phosphorites, and
the like; and that labour would be gladly
done by the factory workers if it were properly
organised in a free community for the benefit
of the whole society. The soil claims that sort
of aid, and it would have it under a proper
organisation, even if it were necessary to stop
many mills in the summer for that purpose.
No doubt the present factory owners would
consider it ruinous if they had to stop their
mills for several months every year, because
the capital engaged in a factory is expected to
pump money every day and every hour, if pos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>sible.
But that is the capitalist’s view of the
matter, not the community’s view.</p>

<p>As to the workers, who ought to be the real
managers of industries, they will find it healthy
<em>not</em> to perform the same monotonous work all
the year round, and they will abandon it for
the summer, if indeed they do not find the
means of keeping the factory running by
relieving each other in groups.</p>

<p>The scattering of industries over the country&mdash;so
as to bring the factory amidst the fields,
to make agriculture derive all those profits
which it always finds in being combined with
industry (see the Eastern States of America)
and to produce a combination of industrial with
agricultural work&mdash;is surely the next step to be
made, as soon as a reorganisation of our present
conditions is possible. It is being made already,
here and there, as we saw on the preceding
pages. This step is imposed by the very necessity
of <em>producing for the producers themselves</em>;
it is imposed by the necessity for each healthy
man and woman to spend a part of their lives
in manual work in the free air; and it will
be rendered the more necessary when the great
social movements, which have now become
unavoidable, come to disturb the present international
trade, and compel each nation to
revert to her own resources for her own main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>tenance.
Humanity as a whole, as well as each
separate individual, will be gainers by the
change, and the change will take place.</p>

<p>However, such a change also implies a
thorough modification of our present system of
education. It implies a society composed of
men and women, each of whom is able to work
with his or her hands, as well as with his or
her brain, and to do so in more directions
than one. This “integration of capacities”
and “integral education” I am now going to
analyse.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_169" href="#FNanchor_169" class="label">[169]</a> The remarks of Prof. Issaieff&mdash;a thorough investigator of
petty trades in Russia, Germany and France&mdash;(see <cite>Works of
the Commission for the Study of Petty Trades in Russia</cite> (Russian),
St. Petersburg, 1879-1887, vol. i.) were for me a valuable guide
when I prepared the first edition of this book. Since that time
the two industrial censuses of 1895 and 1907 have yielded such
a valuable material, that there are quite a number of German
works which came to the same conclusions. I shall mention
them further on.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_171" href="#FNanchor_171" class="label">[171]</a> The foundation for this creed is contained in one of the
concluding chapters of Marx’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kapital</cite> (the last but one), in
which the author spoke of the concentration of capital and saw
in it the “fatality of a natural law.” In the “forties,” this
idea of “concentration of capital,” originated from what was
going on in the textile industries, was continually recurring in
the writings of all the French socialists, especially Considérant,
and their German followers, and it was used by them as an
argument in favour of the necessity of a social revolution.
But Marx was too much of a thinker that he should not have
taken notice of the subsequent developments of industrial life,
which were not foreseen in 1848; if he had lived now, he surely
would <em>not</em> have shut his eyes to the formidable growth of the
numbers of small capitalists and to the middle-class fortunes
which are made in a thousand ways under the shadow of the
modern “millionaires.” Very likely he would have noticed
also the extreme slowness with which the wrecking of small
industries goes on&mdash;a slowness which could not be predicted
fifty or forty years ago, because no one could foresee at that
time the facilities which have been offered since for transport,
the growing variety of demand, nor the cheap means which are
now in use for the supply of motive power in small quantities.
Being a thinker, he would have studied these facts, and very
probably he would have mitigated the absoluteness of his
earlier formulæ, as in fact he did once with regard to the village
community in Russia. It would be most desirable that his
followers should rely less upon abstract formulæ&mdash;easy as they
may be as watchwords in political struggles&mdash;and try to imitate
their teacher in his analysis of <em>concrete</em> economical phenomena.</p>

the most authoritative investigators consider that figure as
below the reality.</p>

<p>Divorce between science and handicraft&mdash;Technical education&mdash;Complete
education&mdash;The Moscow system: applied
at Chicago, Boston, Aberdeen&mdash;Concrete teaching&mdash;Present
waste of time&mdash;Science and technics&mdash;Advantages which
science can derive from a combination of brain work with
manual work.</p>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">In olden times men of science, and especially
those who have done most to forward
the growth of natural philosophy, did not
despise manual work and handicraft. Galileo
made his telescopes with his own hands. Newton
learned in his boyhood the art of managing
tools; he exercised his young mind in contriving
most ingenious machines, and when he
began his researches in optics he was able
himself to grind the lenses for his instruments,
and himself to make the well-known telescope,
which, for its time, was a fine piece of workmanship.
Leibnitz was fond of inventing
machines: windmills and carriages to be
moved without horses preoccupied his mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
as much as mathematical and philosophical
speculations. Linnæus became a botanist while
helping his father&mdash;a practical gardener&mdash;in his
daily work. In short, with our great geniuses
handicraft was no obstacle to abstract researches&mdash;it
rather favoured them. On the other
hand, if the workers of old found but few
opportunities for mastering science, many of
them had, at least, their intelligences stimulated
by the very variety of work which was
performed in the then unspecialised workshops;
and some of them had the benefit of
familiar intercourse with men of science. Watt
and Rennie were friends with Professor Robinson;
Brindley, the road-maker, despite his
fourteenpence-a-day wages, enjoyed intercourse
with educated men, and thus developed his
remarkable engineering faculties; the son of a
well-to-do family could “idle” at a wheel-wright’s
shop, so as to become later on a
Smeaton or a Stephenson.</p>

<p>We have changed all that. Under the pretext
of division of labour, we have sharply
separated the brain worker from the manual
worker. The masses of the workmen do not
receive more scientific education than their
grandfathers did; but they have been deprived
of the education of even the small
workshop, while their boys and girls are driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
into a mine or a factory from the age of thirteen,
and there they soon forget the little they may
have learned at school. As to the men of
science, they despise manual labour. How
few of them would be able to make a telescope,
or even a plainer instrument! Most of them
are not capable of even designing a scientific
instrument, and when they have given a vague
suggestion to the instrument-maker, they leave
it with him to invent the apparatus they need.
Nay, they have raised the contempt of manual
labour to the height of a theory. “The man
of science,” they say, “must discover the laws
of nature, the civil engineer must apply them,
and the worker must execute in steel or wood,
in iron or stone, the patterns devised by the
engineer. He must work with machines invented
for him, not by him. No matter if he
does not understand them and cannot improve
them: the scientific man and the scientific
engineer will take care of the progress of science
and industry.”</p>

<p>It may be objected that nevertheless there is
a class of men who belong to none of the above
three divisions. When young they have been
manual workers, and some of them continue
to be; but, owing to some happy circumstances,
they have succeeded in acquiring some scientific
knowledge, and thus they have combined science<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
with handicraft. Surely there are such men;
happily enough there is a nucleus of men who
have escaped the so-much-advocated specialisation
of labour, and it is precisely to them that
industry owes its chief recent inventions. But
in old Europe, at least, they are the exceptions;
they are the irregulars&mdash;the Cossacks who have
broken the ranks and pierced the screens so carefully
erected between the classes. And they
are so few, in comparison with the ever-growing
requirements of industry&mdash;and of science as
well, as I am about to prove&mdash;that all over the
world we hear complaints about the scarcity
of precisely such men.</p>

<p>What is the meaning, in fact, of the outcry
for technical education which has been raised
at one and the same time in England, in France,
in Germany, in the States, and in Russia, if it
does not express a general dissatisfaction with
the present division into scientists, scientific
engineers, and workers? Listen to those who
know industry, and you will see that the substance
of their complaints is this: “The
worker whose task has been specialised by the
permanent division of labour has lost the
intellectual interest in his labour, and it is
especially so in the great industries: he has lost
his inventive powers. Formerly, he invented
very much. Manual workers&mdash;not men of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
science nor trained engineers&mdash;have invented,
or brought to perfection, the prime motors and
all that mass of machinery which has revolutionised
industry for the last hundred years.
But since the great factory has been enthroned,
the worker, depressed by the monotony of his
work, invents no more. What can a weaver
invent who merely supervises four looms, without
knowing anything either about their complicated
movements or how the machines grew
to be what they are? What can a man
invent who is condemned for life to bind together
the ends of two threads with the greatest
celerity, and knows nothing beyond making a
knot?</p>

<p>“At the outset of modern industry, three
generations of workers <em>have</em> invented; now
they cease to do so. As to the inventions of
the engineers, specially trained for devising
machines, they are either devoid of genius or
not practical enough. Those ‘nearly to nothings,’
of which Sir Frederick Bramwell spoke
once at Bath, are missing in their inventions&mdash;those
nothings which can be learned in the
workshop only, and which permitted a Murdoch
and the Soho workers to make a practical
engine of Watt’s schemes. None but he who
knows the machine&mdash;not in its drawings and
models only, but in its breathing and throbbings&mdash;who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
unconsciously thinks of it while standing
by it, can really improve it. Smeaton and
Newcomen surely were excellent engineers; but
in their engines a boy had to open the steam
valve at each stroke of the piston; and it was
one of those boys who once managed to connect
the valve with the remainder of the machine,
so as to make it open automatically, while he
ran away to play with other boys. But in the
modern machinery there is no room left for
naïve improvements of that kind. Scientific
education on a wide scale has become necessary
for further inventions, and that education is
refused to the workers. So that there is no
issue out of the difficulty, unless scientific education
and handicraft are combined together&mdash;unless
integration of knowledge takes the place
of the present divisions.”</p>

<p>Such is the real substance of the present
movement in favour of technical education.
But, instead of bringing to public consciousness
the, perhaps, unconscious motives of the present
discontent, instead of widening the views of the
discontented and discussing the problem to its
full extent, the mouthpieces of the movement
do not mostly rise above the shopkeeper’s view
of the question. Some of them indulge in jingo
talk about crushing all foreign industries out of
competition, while the others see in technical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
education nothing but a means of somewhat
improving the flesh-machine of the factory
and of transferring a few workers into the upper
class of trained engineers.</p>

<p>Such an ideal may satisfy them, but it cannot
satisfy those who keep in view the combined
interests of science and industry, and consider
both as a means for raising humanity to a higher
level. We maintain that in the interests of
both science and industry, as well as of society
as a whole, every human being, without distinction
of birth, ought to receive such an
education as would enable him, or her, to
combine a thorough knowledge of science
with a thorough knowledge of handicraft.
We fully recognise the necessity of specialisation
of knowledge, but we maintain that
specialisation must follow general education,
and that general education must be given in
science and handicraft alike. To the division of
society into brain workers and manual workers
we oppose the combination of both kinds of
activities; and instead of “technical education,”
which means the maintenance of the
present division between brain work and
manual work, we advocate the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éducation
intégrale</i>, or complete education, which means
the disappearance of that pernicious distinction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span></p>

<p>Plainly stated, the aims of the school under
this system ought to be the following: To give
such an education that, on leaving school at the
age of eighteen or twenty, each boy and each
girl should be endowed with a thorough knowledge
of science&mdash;such a knowledge as might
enable them to be useful workers in science&mdash;and,
at the same time, to give them a general
knowledge of what constitutes the bases of
technical training, and such a skill in some
special trade as would enable each of them to
take his or her place in the grand world of the
manual production of wealth.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> I know that
many will find that aim too large, or even impossible
to attain, but I hope that if they have
the patience to read the following pages, they will
see that we require nothing beyond what can be
easily attained. In fact, <em>it has been attained</em>;
and what has been done on a small scale could
be done on a wider scale, were it not for the
economical and social causes which prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
any serious reform from being accomplished in
our miserably organised society.</p>

<p>The experiment has been made at the Moscow
Technical School for twenty consecutive years
with many hundreds of boys; and, according
to the testimonies of the most competent judges
at the exhibitions of Brussels, Philadelphia,
Vienna, and Paris, the experiment has been a
success. The Moscow school admitted boys not
older than fifteen,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and it required from boys of
that age nothing but a substantial knowledge of
geometry and algebra, together with the usual
knowledge of their mother tongue; younger
pupils were received in the preparatory classes.
The school was divided into two sections&mdash;the
mechanical and the chemical; but as I personally
know better the former, and as it is also the
more important with reference to the question
before us, so I shall limit my remarks to the
education given in the mechanical section.</p>

<p>After a five or six years’ stay at the school, the
students left it with a thorough knowledge of
higher mathematics, physics, mechanics, and connected
sciences&mdash;so thorough, indeed, that it was
not second to that acquired in the best mathematical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
faculties of the most eminent European
universities. When myself a student of the
mathematical faculty of the St. Petersburg
University, I had the opportunity of comparing
the knowledge of the students at the Moscow
Technical School with our own. I saw the courses
of higher geometry some of them had compiled
for the use of their comrades; I admired the
facility with which they applied the integral
calculus to dynamical problems, and I came to
the conclusion that while we, University students,
had more knowledge of a general character (for
instance, in mathematical astronomy), they, the
students of the Technical School, were much
more advanced in higher geometry, and especially
in the applications of higher mathematics to the
intricate problems of dynamics, the theories of
heat and elasticity. But while we, the students
of the University, hardly knew the use of our
hands, the students of the Technical School
fabricated <em>with their own hands</em>, and without the
help of professional workmen, fine steam-engines,
from the heavy boiler to the last finely turned
screw, agricultural machinery, and scientific
apparatus&mdash;all for the trade&mdash;and they received
the highest awards for the work of their hands at
the international exhibitions. They were scientifically
educated skilled workers&mdash;workers with
university education&mdash;highly appreciated even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
by the Russian manufacturers who so much
distrust science.</p>

<p>Now, the methods by which these wonderful
results were achieved were these: In science,
learning from memory was not in honour, while
independent research was favoured by all means.
Science was taught hand in hand with its applications,
and what was learned in the schoolroom
was applied in the workshop. Great attention
was paid to the highest abstractions of geometry
as a means for developing imagination and
research.</p>

<p>As to the teaching of handicraft, the methods
were quite different from those which proved a
failure at the Cornell University, and differed, in
fact, from those used in most technical schools.
The student was not sent to a workshop to learn
some special handicraft and to earn his existence
as soon as possible; but the teaching of technical
skill was prosecuted in the same systematical
way as laboratory work is taught in the universities,
according to a scheme elaborated by the
founder of the school, M. Dellavos, and now
applied at Chicago and Boston. It is evident
that drawing was considered as the first step in
technical education. Then the student was
brought, first, to the carpenter’s workshop, or
rather laboratory, and there he was thoroughly
taught to execute all kinds of carpentry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
joinery. They did not teach the pupil to make
some insignificant work of house decoration, as
they do in the system of the <i lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">slöjd</i>&mdash;the Swedish
method, which is taught especially at the Nääs
school&mdash;but they taught him, to begin with, to
make very accurately a wooden cube, a prism,
a cylinder (with the planing jack), and then&mdash;all
fundamental types of joining. In a word, he
had to study, so to say, the philosophy of joinery
by means of manual work. No efforts were
spared in order to bring the pupil to a certain
perfection in that branch&mdash;the real basis of all
trades.</p>

<p>Later on, the pupil was transferred to the
turner’s workshop, where he was taught to make
in wood the patterns of those things which he
would have to make in metal in the following
workshops. The foundry followed, and there
he was taught to cast those parts of machines
which he had prepared in wood; and it was
only after he had gone through the first three
stages that he was admitted to the smith’s and
engineering workshops. Such was the system
which English readers will find described in full
in a work by Mr. Ch. H. Ham.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> As for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
perfection of the mechanical work of the students,
I cannot do better than refer to the reports of
the juries at the above-named exhibitions.</p>

<p>In America the same system has been introduced,
in its technical part, first, in the Chicago
Manual Training School, and later on in the
Boston Technical School&mdash;the best, I am told,
of the sort&mdash;and <ins class="corr" id="tn-375" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'finally at Tuskagee'">
finally at Tuskegee</ins>, in the excellent
school for coloured young men. In this
country, or rather in Scotland, I found the
system applied with full success, for some years,
under the direction of Dr. Ogilvie at Gordon’s
College in Aberdeen. It is the Moscow or Chicago
system on a limited scale. While receiving
substantial scientific education, the pupils are
also trained in the workshops&mdash;but not for one
special trade, as it unhappily too often is the
case. They pass through the carpenter’s workshop,
the casting in metals, and the engineering
workshop; and in each of these they learn the
foundations of each of the three trades sufficiently
well for supplying the school itself with a number
of useful things. Besides, as far as I could
ascertain from what I saw in the geographical
and physical classes, as also in the chemical
laboratory, the system of “through the hand to
the brain,” and <em>vice versâ</em>, is in full swing, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
is attended with the best success. The boys
<em>work</em> with the physical instruments, and they
study geography in the field, instruments in
hands, as well as in the class-room. Some of
their surveys filled my heart, as an old geographer,
with joy.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>The Moscow Technical School surely was not
an ideal school.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> It totally neglected the humanitarian
education of the young men. But we
must recognise that the Moscow experiment&mdash;not
to speak of hundreds of other partial experiments&mdash;has
perfectly well proved the possibility
of combining a scientific education of a very
high standard with the education which is
necessary for becoming an excellent skilled
workman. It has proved, moreover, that the
best means for producing really good skilled
labourers is to seize the bull by the horns, and to
grasp the educational problem in its great features,
instead of trying to give some special skill
in some handicraft, together with a few scraps of
knowledge in a certain branch of some science.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
And it has shown also what can be obtained,
without over-pressure, if a rational economy
of the scholar’s time is always kept in view,
and theory goes hand in hand with practice.
Viewed in this light, the Moscow results do not
seem extraordinary at all, and still better results
may be expected if the same principles are applied
from the earliest years of education.</p>

<p>Waste of time is the leading feature of our
present education. Not only are we taught a
mass of rubbish, but what is not rubbish is taught
so as to make us waste over it as much time
as possible. Our present methods of teaching
originate from a time when the accomplishments
required from an educated person were extremely
limited; and they have been maintained, notwithstanding
the immense increase of knowledge
which must be conveyed to the scholar’s
mind since science has so much widened its former
limits. Hence the over-pressure in schools,
and hence, also, the urgent necessity of totally
revising both the subjects and the methods of
teaching, according to the new wants and to the
examples already given here and there, by separate
schools and separate teachers.</p>

<p>It is evident that the years of childhood ought
not to be spent so uselessly as they are now.
German teachers have shown how the very plays
of children can be made instrumental in convey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>ing
to the childish mind some concrete knowledge
in both geometry and mathematics. The children
who have made the squares of the theorem
of Pythagoras out of pieces of coloured cardboard,
will not look at the theorem, when it
comes in geometry, as on a mere instrument
of torture devised by the teachers; and the less
so if they apply it as the carpenters do. Complicated
problems of arithmetic, which so much
harassed us in our boyhood, are easily solved by
children seven and eight years old if they are
put in the shape of interesting puzzles. And if
the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kindergarten</i>&mdash;German teachers often make
of it a kind of barrack in which each movement
of the child is regulated beforehand&mdash;has often
become a small prison for the little ones, the idea
which presided at its foundation is nevertheless
true. In fact, it is almost impossible to imagine,
without having tried it, how many sound notions
of nature, habits of classification, and taste for
natural sciences can be conveyed to the children’s
minds; and, if a series of concentric courses
adapted to the various phases of development of
the human being were generally accepted in
education, the first series in all sciences, save
sociology, could be taught before the age of ten
or twelve, so as to give a general idea of the
universe, the earth and its inhabitants, the chief
physical, chemical, zoological, and botanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
phenomena, leaving the discovery of the <em>laws</em> of
those phenomena to the next series of deeper
and more specialised studies.</p>

<p>On the other side, we all know how children
like to make toys themselves, how they gladly
imitate the work of full-grown people if they see
them at work in the workshop or the building-yard.
But the parents either stupidly paralyse
that passion, or do not know how to utilise it.
Most of them despise manual work and prefer
sending their children to the study of Roman
history, or of Franklin’s teachings about saving
money, to seeing them at a work which is
good for the “lower classes only.” They thus
do their best to render subsequent learning
the more difficult.</p>

<p>And then come the school years, and time is
wasted again to an incredible extent. Take,
for instance, mathematics, which every one
ought to know, because it is the basis of all subsequent
education, and which so few really learn
in our schools. In geometry, time is foolishly
wasted by using a method which merely consists
in committing geometry to memory. In
most cases, the boy reads again and again the
proof of a theorem till his memory has retained
the succession of reasonings. Therefore, nine
boys out of ten, if asked to prove an elementary
theorem two years after having left the school,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
will be unable to do it, unless mathematics is
their speciality. They will forget which auxiliary
lines to draw, and they never have been taught
to <em>discover</em> the proofs by themselves. No wonder
that later on they find such difficulties in applying
geometry to physics, that their progress is
despairingly sluggish, and that so few master
higher mathematics.</p>

<p>There is, however, the other method which permits
the pupil to progress, as a whole, at a much
speedier rate, and under which he who once has
learned geometry will know it all his life long.
Under this system, each theorem is put as a
problem; its solution is never given beforehand,
and the pupil is induced to find it by himself.
Thus, if some preliminary exercises with the
rule and the compass have been made, there is
not one boy or girl, out of twenty or more, who
will not be able to find the means of drawing
an angle which is equal to a given angle, and to
prove their equality, after a few suggestions from
the teacher; and if the subsequent problems
are given in a systematic succession (there are
excellent text-books for the purpose), and the
teacher does not press his pupils to go faster
than they can go at the beginning, they advance
from one problem to the next with an
astonishing facility, the only difficulty being
to bring the pupil to solve the first problem,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
and thus to acquire confidence in his own
reasoning.</p>

<p>Moreover, each abstract geometrical truth
must be impressed on the mind in its concrete
form as well. As soon as the pupils have solved
a few problems on paper, they must solve them
in the playing-ground with a few sticks and a
string, and they must apply their knowledge in
the workshop. Only then will the geometrical
lines acquire a concrete meaning in the children’s
minds; only then will they see that the teacher
is playing no tricks when he asks them to solve
problems with the rule and the compass without
resorting to the protractor; only then will they
<em>know</em> geometry.</p>

<p>“Through the eyes <em>and</em> the hand to the brain”&mdash;this
is the true principle of economy of time in
teaching. I remember, as if it were yesterday,
how geometry suddenly acquired for me a new
meaning, and how this new meaning facilitated
all ulterior studies. It was as we were mastering
at school a Montgolfier balloon, and I remarked
that the angles at the summits of each of the
twenty strips of paper out of which we were
going to make the balloon must cover less than
the fifth part of a right angle each. I remember,
next, how the sinuses and the tangents ceased
to be mere cabalistic signs when they permitted
us to calculate the length of a stick in a working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
profile of a fortification; and how geometry in
space became plain when we began to make on a
small scale a bastion with embrasures and barbettes&mdash;an
occupation which obviously was soon
prohibited on account of the state into which we
brought our clothes. “You look like navvies,”
was the reproach addressed to us by our intelligent
educators, while we were proud precisely of
being navvies, and of discovering the use of
geometry.</p>

<p>By compelling our children to study real
things from mere graphical representations, instead
of <em>making</em> those things themselves, we
compel them to waste the most precious time;
we uselessly worry their minds; we accustom
them to the worst methods of learning; we kill
independent thought in the bud; and very
seldom we succeed in conveying a real knowledge
of what we are teaching. Superficiality, parrot-like
repetition, slavishness and inertia of mind
are the results of our method of education. We
do not teach our children how to learn.</p>

<p>The very beginnings of science are taught on
the same pernicious system. In most schools
even arithmetic is taught in the abstract way,
and mere rules are stuffed into the poor little
heads. The idea of a unit, which is arbitrary
and can be changed at will in our measurement
(the match, the box of matches, the dozen of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
boxes, or the gross; the metre, the centimetre,
the kilometre, and so on), is not impressed on the
mind, and therefore when the children come to
the decimal fractions they are at a loss to understand
them. In this country, the United States
and Russia, instead of accepting the decimal
system, which is the system of our numeration,
they still torture the children by making them
learn a system of weights and measures which
ought to have been abandoned long since. The
pupils lose at that full two years, and when they
come later on to problems in mechanics and
physics, schoolboys and schoolgirls spend most
of their time in endless calculations which only
fatigue them and inspire in them a dislike of
exact science. But even there, where the decimal
measures have been introduced, much time is lost
in school simply because the teachers are not
accustomed to the idea that every measure is
only approximate, and that it is absurd to calculate
with the exactitude of one gramme, or
of one metre, when the measuring itself does not
give the elements of such an exactitude. Whereas
in France, where the decimal system of measures
and money is a matter of daily life, even
those workers who have received the plainest
elementary education are quite familiar with
decimals. To represent twenty-five centimes,
or twenty-five centimetres, they write “zero<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
twenty-five,” while most of my readers surely
remember how this same zero at the head of a
row of figures puzzled them in their boyhood.
We do all that is possible to render algebra unintelligible,
and our children spend one year
before they have learned what is not algebra
at all, but a mere system of abbreviations,
which can be learned by the way, if it is taught
together with arithmetic.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>The waste of time in physics is simply revolting.
While young people very easily understand
the principles of chemistry and its formulæ,
as soon as they themselves make the first experiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
with a few glasses and tubes, they
mostly find the greatest difficulties in grasping
the mechanical introduction into physics, partly
because they do not know geometry, and especially
because they are merely shown costly
machines instead of being induced to make
themselves plain apparatus for illustrating the
phenomena they study.</p>

<p>Instead of learning the laws of force with
plain instruments which a boy of fifteen can
easily make, they learn them from mere drawings,
in a purely abstract fashion. Instead of
making themselves an Atwood’s machine with a
broomstick and the wheel of an old clock, or
verifying the laws of falling bodies with a key
gliding on an inclined string, they are shown
a complicated apparatus, and in most cases the
teacher himself does not know how to explain
to them the principle of the apparatus, and
indulges in irrelevant details. And so it goes
on from the beginning to the end, with but a
few honourable exceptions.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span></p>

<p>If waste of time is characteristic of our methods
of teaching science, it is characteristic as well
of the methods used for teaching handicraft.
We know how years are wasted when a boy
serves his apprenticeship in a workshop; but
the same reproach can be addressed, to a great
extent, to those technical schools which endeavour
at once to teach some special handicraft,
instead of resorting to the broader and surer
methods of systematical teaching. Just as
there are in science some notions and methods
which are preparatory to the study of all sciences,
so there are also some fundamental notions and
methods preparatory to the special study of any
handicraft.</p>

<p>Reuleaux has shown in that delightful book,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Theoretische Kinematik</cite>, that there is, so to
say, a philosophy of all possible machinery.
Each machine, however complicated, can be
reduced to a few elements&mdash;plates, cylinders,
discs, cones, and so on&mdash;as well as to a few
tools&mdash;chisels, saws, rollers, hammers, etc.;
and, however complicated its movements, they
can be decomposed into a few modifications of
motion, such as the transformation of circular
motion into a rectilinear, and the like, with a
number of intermediate links. So also each
handicraft can be decomposed into a number
of elements. In each trade one must know how
to make a plate with parallel surfaces, a cylinder,
a disc, a square, and a round hole; how to
manage a limited number of tools, all tools
being mere modifications of less than a dozen
types; and how to transform one kind of motion
into another. This is the foundation of all
mechanical handicrafts; so that the knowledge
of how to make in wood those primary elements,
how to manage the chief tools in wood-work,
and how to transform various kinds of motion
ought to be considered as the very basis for the
subsequent teaching of all possible kinds of
mechanical handicraft. The pupil who has
acquired that skill already knows one good
half of all possible trades.</p>

<p>Besides, none can be a good worker in science<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
unless he is in possession of good methods of
scientific research; unless he has learned to
observe, to describe with exactitude, to discover
mutual relations between facts seemingly
disconnected, to make inductive hypotheses
and to verify them, to reason upon cause and
effect, and so on. And none can be a good
manual worker unless he has been accustomed
to the good methods of handicraft altogether.
He must grow accustomed to conceive the
subject of his thoughts in a concrete form, to
draw it, or to model, to hate badly kept tools
and bad methods of work, to give to everything
a fine touch of finish, to derive artistic enjoyment
from the contemplation of gracious forms
and combinations of colours, and dissatisfaction
from what is ugly. Be it handicraft, science, or
art, the chief aim of the school is not to make a
specialist from a beginner, but to teach him the
elements of knowledge and the good methods
of work, and, above all, to give him that general
inspiration which will induce him, later on, to
put in whatever he does a sincere longing for
truth, to like what is beautiful, both as to form
and contents, to feel the necessity of being a
useful unit amidst other human units, and thus
to feel his heart at unison with the rest of
humanity.</p>

<p>As for avoiding the monotony of work which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
would result from the pupil always making
mere cylinders and discs, and never making
full machines or other useful things, there are
thousands of means for avoiding that want of
interest, and one of them, in use at Moscow,
is worthy of notice. It was, not to give work for
mere exercise, but to utilise everything which
the pupil makes, from his very first steps.
Do you remember how you were delighted, in
your childhood, if your work was utilised, be
it only as a part of something useful? So they
did at Moscow. Each plank planed by the
pupils was utilised as a part of some machine
in some of the other workshops. When a
pupil came to the engineering workshop, and
was set to make a quadrangular block of iron
with parallel and perpendicular surfaces, the
block had an interest in his eyes, because, when
he had finished it, verified its angles and surfaces,
and corrected its defects, the block was
not thrown under the bench&mdash;it was given to a
more advanced pupil, who made a handle to
it, painted the whole, and sent it to the shop of
the school as a paper-weight. The systematical
teaching thus received the necessary attractiveness.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span></p>

<p>It is evident that celerity of work is a most
important factor in production. So it might
be asked if, under the above system, the necessary
speed of work could be obtained. But there
are two kinds of celerity. There is the celerity
which I saw in a Nottingham lace-factory:
full-grown men, with shivering hands and
heads, were feverishly binding together the ends
of two threads from the remnants of cotton-yarn
in the bobbins; you hardly could follow
their movements. But the very fact of requiring
such kind of rapid work is the condemnation
of the factory system. What has
remained of the human being in those shivering
bodies? What will be their outcome?
Why this waste of human force, when it could
produce ten times the value of the odd rests of
yarn? This kind of celerity is required exclusively
because of the cheapness of the
factory slaves; so let us hope that no school
will ever aim at this kind of quickness in work.</p>

<p>But there is also the time-saving celerity
of the well-trained worker, and this is surely
achieved best by the kind of education which
we advocate. However plain his work, the
educated worker makes it better and quicker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
than the uneducated. Observe, for instance,
how a good worker proceeds in cutting anything&mdash;say
a piece of cardboard&mdash;and compare his
movements with those of an improperly trained
worker. The latter seizes the cardboard, takes
the tool as it is, traces a line in a haphazard way,
and begins to cut; half-way he is tired, and
when he has finished his work is worth nothing;
whereas, the former will examine his tool and
improve it if necessary; he will trace the
line with exactitude, secure both cardboard and
rule, keep the tool in the right way, cut quite
easily, and give you a piece of good work.</p>

<p>This is the true time-saving celerity, the most
appropriate for economising human labour;
and the best means for attaining it is an education
of the most superior kind. The great
masters painted with an astonishing rapidity;
but their rapid work was the result of a great
development of intelligence and imagination,
of a keen sense of beauty, of a fine perception of
colours. And that is the kind of rapid work
of which humanity is in need.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much more ought to be said as regards the
duties of the school, but I hasten to say a few
words more as to the desirability of the kind of
education briefly sketched in the preceding
pages. Certainly, I do not cherish the illusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
that a thorough reform in education, or in any
of the issues indicated in the preceding chapters,
will be made as long as the civilised nations
remain under the present narrowly egotistic
system of production and consumption. All
we can expect, as long as the present conditions
last, is to have some microscopical attempts
at reforming here and there on a small
scale&mdash;attempts which necessarily will prove
to be far below the expected results, because
of the impossibility of reforming on a small
scale when so intimate a connection exists
between the manifold functions of a civilised
nation. But the energy of the constructive
genius of society depends chiefly upon the
depths of its conception as to what ought to
be done, and how; and the necessity of re-casting
education is one of those necessities
which are most comprehensible to all, and are
most appropriate for inspiring society with those
ideals, without which stagnation or even decay
are unavoidable.</p>

<p>So let us suppose that a community&mdash;a city,
or a territory which has, at least, a few millions
of inhabitants&mdash;gives the above-sketched education
to all its children, without distinction of
birth (and we <em>are</em> rich enough to permit us the
luxury of such an education), without asking
anything in return from the children but what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
they will give when they have become producers
of wealth. Suppose such an education is
given, and analyse its probable consequences.</p>

<p>I will not insist upon the increase of wealth
which would result from having a young army
of educated and well-trained producers; nor
shall I insist upon the social benefits which
would be derived from erasing the present
distinction between the brain workers and the
manual workers, and from thus reaching the
concordance of interest and harmony so much
wanted in our times of social struggles. I
shall not dwell upon the fulness of life which
would result for each separate individual, if he
were enabled to enjoy the use of both his mental
and bodily powers; nor upon the advantages
of raising manual labour to the place of honour
it ought to occupy in society, instead of being
a stamp of inferiority, as it is now. Nor shall
I insist upon the disappearance of the present
misery and degradation, with all their consequences&mdash;vice,
crime, prisons, price of blood,
denunciation, and the like&mdash;which necessarily
would follow. In short, I will not touch now
the great social question, upon which so much
has been written and so much remains to be
written yet. I merely intend to point out in
these pages the benefits which science itself
would derive from the change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span></p>

<p>Some will say, of course, that to reduce men
of science to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of manual workers would
mean the decay of science and genius. But those
who will take into account the following considerations
probably will agree that the result ought
to be the reverse&mdash;namely, such a revival of
science and art, and such a progress in industry,
as we only can faintly foresee from what we
know about the times of the Renaissance. It
has become a commonplace to speak with
emphasis about the progress of science during
the nineteenth century; and it is evident
that our century, if compared with centuries
past, has much to be proud of. But, if we take
into account that most of the problems which
our century has solved already had been indicated,
and their solutions foreseen, a hundred
years ago, we must admit that the progress
was not so rapid as might have been expected,
and that something hampered it.</p>

<p>The mechanical theory of heat was very
well foreseen in the last century by Rumford
and Humphry Davy, and even in Russia it
was advocated by Lomonosoff.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> However, much
more than half a century elapsed before the
theory reappeared in science. Lamarck, and
even Linnæus, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Erasmus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
Darwin, and several others were fully aware of
the variability of species; they were opening
the way for the construction of biology on the
principles of variation; but here, again, half a
century was wasted before the variability of
species was brought again to the front; and we
all remember how Darwin’s ideas were carried
on and forced on the attention of university
people, chiefly by persons who were not professional
scientists themselves; and yet in
Darwin’s hands the theory of evolution surely
was narrowed, owing to the overwhelming
importance given to only one factor of evolution.</p>

<p>For many years past astronomy has been
needing a careful revision of the Kant and
Laplace’s hypothesis; but no theory is yet
forthcoming which would compel general acceptance.
Geology surely has made wonderful
progress in the reconstitution of the palæontological
record, but dynamical geology progresses
at a despairingly slow rate; while all
future progress in the great question as to
the laws of distribution of living organisms
on the surface of the earth is hampered by
the want of knowledge as to the extension of
glaciation during the Quaternary epoch.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span></p>

<p>In short, in each branch of science a revision
of the current theories as well as new wide
generalisations are wanted. And if the revision
requires some of that inspiration of genius
which moved Galileo and Newton, and which
depends in its appearance upon general causes
of human development, it requires also an
increase in the number of scientific workers.
When facts contradictory to current theories
become numerous, the theories must be revised
(we saw it in Darwin’s case), and thousands
of simple intelligent workers in science are
required to accumulate the necessary facts.</p>

<p>Immense regions of the earth still remain
unexplored; the study of the geographical dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>tribution
of animals and plants meets with
stumbling-blocks at every step. Travellers
cross continents, and do not know even how
to determine the latitude nor how to manage
a barometer. Physiology, both of plants and
animals, psycho-physiology, and the psychological
faculties of man and animals are so many
branches of knowledge requiring more data
of the simplest description. History remains
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fable convenue</i> chiefly because it wants fresh
ideas, but also because it wants scientifically
thinking workers to reconstitute the life of
past centuries in the same way as Thorold
Rogers or Augustin Thierry have done it for
separate epochs.</p>

<p>In short, there is not one single science which
does not suffer in its development from a want
of men and women endowed with a philosophical
conception of the universe, ready to apply
their forces of investigation in a given field,
however limited, and having leisure for devoting
themselves to scientific pursuits. In a community
such as we suppose, thousands of
workers would be ready to answer any appeal
for exploration. Darwin spent almost thirty
years in gathering and analysing facts for the
elaboration of the theory of the origin of species.
Had he lived in such a society as we suppose,
he simply would have made an appeal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
volunteers for facts and partial exploration, and
thousands of explorers would have answered his
appeal. Scores of societies would have come
to life to debate and to solve each of the partial
problems involved in the theory, and in ten
years the theory would have been verified;
all those factors of evolution which only now
begin to receive due attention would have
appeared in their full light. The rate of scientific
progress would have been tenfold; and if
the individual would not have the same claims
on posterity’s gratitude as he has now, the
unknown mass would have done the work with
more speed and with more prospect for ulterior
advance than the individual could do in his
lifetime. Mr. Murray’s dictionary is an illustration
of that kind of work&mdash;the work of the future.</p>

<p>However, there is another feature of modern
science which speaks more strongly yet in
favour of the change we advocate. While
industry, especially by the end of the last
century and during the first part of the present,
has been inventing on such a scale as to revolutionise
the very face of the earth, science has
been losing its inventive powers. Men of science
invent no more, or very little. Is it not striking,
indeed, that the steam-engine, even in its
leading principles, the railway-engine, the steam-boat,
the telephone, the phonograph, the weav<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>ing-machine,
the lace-machine, the lighthouse,
the macadamised road, photography in black
and in colours, and thousands of less important
things, have <em>not</em> been invented by professional
men of science, although none of them would
have refused to associate his name with any of
the above-named inventions? Men who hardly
had received any education at school, who had
merely picked up the crumbs of knowledge from
the tables of the rich, and who made their
experiments with the most primitive means&mdash;the
attorney’s clerk Smeaton, the instrument-maker
Watt, the brakesman Stephenson, the
jeweller’s apprentice Fulton, the millwright
Rennie, the mason Telford, and hundreds of
others whose very names remain unknown,
were, as Mr. Smiles justly says, “the real makers
of modern civilisation”; while the professional
men of science, provided with all means for
acquiring knowledge and experimenting, have
invented little in the formidable array of
implements, machines, and prime-motors which
has shown to humanity how to utilise and to
manage the forces of nature.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The fact is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
striking, but its explanation is very simple:
those men&mdash;the Watts and the Stephensons&mdash;knew
something which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i> do not know&mdash;they
knew the use of their hands; their
surroundings stimulated their inventive powers;
they knew machines, their leading principles,
and their work; they had breathed the atmosphere
of the workshop and the building-yard.</p>

<p>We know how men of science will meet the
reproach. They will say: “We discover the
laws of nature, let others apply them; it is a
simple division of labour.” But such a rejoinder
would be utterly untrue. The march
of progress is quite the reverse, because in a
hundred cases against one the mechanical
invention comes before the discovery of the
scientific law. It was not the dynamical
theory of heat which came before the steam-engine&mdash;it
followed it.</p>

<p>When thousands of engines already were
transforming heat into motion under the eyes
of hundreds of professors, and when they had
done so for half a century, or more; when
thousands of trains, stopped by powerful brakes,
were disengaging heat and spreading sheaves
of sparks on the rails at their approach to the
stations; when all over the civilised world
heavy hammers and perforators were rendering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
burning hot the masses of iron they were
hammering and perforating&mdash;then, and then
only, Séguin, senior, in France, and a doctor,
Mayer, in Germany, ventured to bring out the
mechanical theory of heat with all its consequences:
and yet the men of science ignored
the work of Séguin and almost drove Mayer
to madness by obstinately clinging to their
mysterious caloric fluid. Worse than that,
they described Joule’s first determination of
the mechanical equivalent of heat as “unscientific.”</p>

<p>When thousands of engines had been illustrating
for some time the impossibility of
utilising all the heat disengaged by a given
amount of burnt fuel, then came the second
law of Clausius. When all over the world
industry already was transforming motion into
heat, sound, light, and electricity, and each one
into each other, then only came Grove’s theory
of the “correlation of physical forces”; and
Grove’s work had the same fate before the
Royal Society as Joule’s. The publication of
his memoir was refused till the year 1856.</p>

<p>It was not the theory of electricity which
gave us the telegraph. When the telegraph
was invented, all we knew about electricity was
but a few facts more or less badly arranged in
our books; the theory of electricity is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
ready yet; it still waits for its Newton, notwithstanding
the brilliant attempts of late
years. Even the empirical knowledge of the
laws of electrical currents was in its infancy
when a few bold men laid a cable at the bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean, despite the warnings of
the authorised men of science.</p>

<p>The name of “applied science” is quite
misleading, because, in the great majority of
cases, invention, far from being an application
of science, on the contrary creates a new
branch of science. The American bridges
were no application of the theory of elasticity;
they came before the theory, and all we can
say in favour of science is, that in this special
branch, theory and practice developed in a
parallel way, helping one another. It was not
the theory of the explosives which led to the
discovery of gunpowder; gunpowder was in
use for centuries before the action of the gases
in a gun was submitted to scientific analysis.
And so on. One could easily multiply the
illustrations by quoting the great processes of
metallurgy; the alloys and the properties they
acquire from the addition of very small amounts
of some metals or metalloids; the recent
revival of electric lighting; nay, even the
weather forecasts which truly deserved the
reproach of being “unscientific” when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
were started for the first time by that excellent
observer of shooting stars, Mathieu de la Drôme,
and by an old Jack tar, Fitzroy&mdash;all these could
be mentioned as instances in point.</p>

<p>Of course, we have a number of cases in which
the discovery, or the invention, was a mere
application of a scientific law (cases like the
discovery of the planet Neptune), but in the
immense majority of cases the discovery, or the
invention, is unscientific to begin with. It
belongs much more to the domain of art&mdash;art
taking the precedence over science, as Helmholtz
has so well shown in one of his popular
lectures&mdash;and only after the invention has been
made, science comes to interpret it. It is
obvious that each invention avails itself of the
previously accumulated knowledge and modes
of thought; but in most cases it makes a
start in advance upon what is known; it makes
a leap in the unknown, and thus opens a quite
new series of facts for investigation. This
character of invention, which is to make a
start in advance of former knowledge, instead
of merely applying a law, makes it identical, as
to the processes of mind, with discovery; and,
therefore, people who are slow in invention are
also slow in discovery.</p>

<p>In most cases, the inventor, however inspired
by the general state of science at a given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
moment, starts with a very few settled facts
at his disposal. The scientific facts taken into
account for inventing the steam-engine, or the
telegraph, or the phonograph were strikingly
elementary. So that we can affirm that what
we presently know is already sufficient for
resolving any of the great problems which
stand in the order of the day&mdash;prime-motors
without the use of steam, the storage of energy,
the transmission of force, or the flying-machine.
If these problems are not yet solved, it is
merely because of the want of inventive genius,
the scarcity of educated men endowed with it,
and the present divorce between science and
industry.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> On the one side, we have men who
are endowed with capacities for invention, but
have neither the necessary scientific knowledge
nor the means for experimenting during long
years; and, on the other side, we have men
endowed with knowledge and facilities for experimenting,
but devoid of inventive genius,
owing to their education, too abstract, too
scholastic, too bookish, and to the surroundings
they live in&mdash;not to speak of the patent
system, which divides and scatters the efforts of
the inventors instead of combining them.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span></p>

<p>The flight of genius which has characterised
the workers at the outset of modern industry
has been missing in our professional men of
science. And they will not recover it as long as
they remain strangers to the world, amidst their
dusty bookshelves; as long as they are not
workers themselves, amidst other workers, at
the blaze of the iron furnace, at the machine
in the factory, at the turning-lathe in the engineering
workshop; sailors amidst sailors on
the sea, and fishers in the fishing-boat, wood-cutters
in the forest, tillers of the soil in the
field.</p>

<p>Our teachers in art&mdash;Ruskin and his school&mdash;have
repeatedly told us of late that we must not
expect a revival of art as long as handicraft
remains what it is; they have shown how Greek
and mediæval art were daughters of handicraft,
how one was feeding the other. The same is
true with regard to handicraft and science;
their separation is the decay of both. As to the
grand inspirations which unhappily have been so
much neglected in most of the recent discussions
about art&mdash;and which are missing in science as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
well&mdash;these can be expected only when humanity,
breaking its present bonds, shall make a new start
in the higher principles of solidarity, doing away
with the present duality of moral sense and
philosophy.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that all men and women
cannot equally enjoy the pursuit of scientific
work. The variety of inclinations is such that
some will find more pleasure in science, some
others in art, and others again in some of the
numberless branches of the production of wealth.
But, whatever the occupations preferred by
everyone, everyone will be the more useful in
his own branch if he is in possession of a serious
scientific knowledge. And, whosoever he might
be&mdash;scientist or artist, physicist or surgeon,
chemist or sociologist, historian or poet&mdash;he
would be the gainer if he spent a part of
his life in the workshop or the farm (the workshop
<em>and</em> the farm), if he were in contact with
humanity in its daily work, and had the
satisfaction of knowing that he himself discharges
his duties as an unprivileged producer
of wealth.</p>

<p>How much better the historian and the sociologist
would understand humanity if they
knew it, not in books only, not in a few of its
representatives, but as a whole, in its daily life,
daily work, and daily affairs! How much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
medicine would trust to hygiene, and how much
less to prescriptions, if the young doctors were
the nurses of the sick and the nurses received
the education of the doctors of our time! And
how much the poet would gain in his feeling of
the beauties of nature, how much better would he
know the human heart, if he met the rising sun
amidst the tillers of the soil, himself a tiller;
if he fought against the storm with the sailors
on board ship; if he knew the poetry of labour
and rest, sorrow and joy, struggle and conquest!
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Greift nur hinein in’s volle Menschenleben!</i>
Goethe said; <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein jeder lebt’s&mdash;nicht vielen ist’s
bekannt.</i> But how few poets follow his advice!</p>

<p>The so-called “division of labour” has grown
under a system which condemned the masses to
toil all the day long, and all the life long, at the
same wearisome kind of labour. But if we take
into account how few are the real producers of
wealth in our present society, and how squandered
is their labour, we must recognise that
Franklin was right in saying that to work five
hours a day would generally do for supplying each
member of a civilised nation with the comfort
now accessible for the few only.</p>

<p>But we have made some progress since Franklin’s
time, and some of that progress in the hitherto
most backward branch of production&mdash;agri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>culture&mdash;has
been indicated in the preceding
pages. Even in that branch the productivity
of labour can be immensely increased, and work
itself rendered easy and pleasant. If everyone
took his share of production, and if production
were socialised&mdash;as political economy, if it aimed
at the satisfaction of the ever-growing needs
of all, would advise us to do&mdash;then more than
one half of the working day would remain to
everyone for the pursuit of art, science, or any
hobby he or she might prefer; and his work in
those fields would be the more profitable if he
spent the other half of the day in productive
work&mdash;if art and science were followed from
mere inclination, not for mercantile purposes.
Moreover, a community organised on the principles
of all being workers would be rich enough
to conclude that every man and woman, after
having reached a certain age&mdash;say of forty or
more&mdash;ought to be relieved from the moral
obligation of taking a direct part in the performance
of the necessary manual work, so as to be
able entirely to devote himself or herself to
whatever he or she chooses in the domain of
art, or science, or any kind of work. Free pursuit
in new branches of art and knowledge, free
creation, and free development thus might be
fully guaranteed. And such a community
would not know misery amidst wealth. It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>
not know the duality of conscience which permeates
our life and stifles every noble effort.
It would freely take its flight towards the highest
regions of progress compatible with human
nature.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_185" href="#FNanchor_185" class="label">[185]</a> In their examination of the causes of unemployment in
York, based not on economists’ hypotheses, but on a close study
of the real facts in each individual case (<cite>Unemployment: a
Social Study</cite>, London, 1911), Seebohm Rowntree and Mr.
Bruno Lasker have come to the conclusion that the chief cause of
unemployment is that young people, after having left the school
(where they learn no trade), find employment in such professions
as greengrocer boy, newspaper boy, and the like, which represent
“a blind alley.” When they reach the age of eighteen or
twenty, they must leave, because the wages are a boy’s wages,&mdash;and
they know no trade whatever!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_186" href="#FNanchor_186" class="label">[186]</a> Unfortunately, I must already say “admitted” instead of
“admits.” With the reaction which began after 1881, under the
reign of Alexander III., this school was “reformed”; that
means that all the spirit and the system of the school were
destroyed.</p>

I can add that like results were achieved also at the Krasnoufimsk
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Realschule</i>, in the province of Orenburg, especially with
regard to agriculture and agricultural machinery. The achievements
of the school, however, are so interesting that they
deserve more than a short mention.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_188" href="#FNanchor_188" class="label">[188]</a> It is evident that the Gordon’s College industrial department
is not a mere copy of any foreign school; on the contrary, I
cannot help thinking that if Aberdeen has made that excellent
move towards combining science with handicraft, the move
was a natural outcome of what has been practised long since, on
a smaller scale, in the Aberdeen daily schools.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_189" href="#FNanchor_189" class="label">[189]</a> What this school is now, I don’t know. In the first years of
Alexander III.’s reign it was wrecked, like so many other good
institutions of the early part of the reign of Alexander II.
But the system was not lost. It was carried over to America.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="label">[190]</a> To those readers who are really interested in the education
of children, M. Leray, the French translator of this book, recommended
a series of excellent little works “conceived,” he wrote,
“in the very spirit of the ideas developed in this chapter.
Their leading principle is that ‘in order to be soundly educative,
all teaching must be objective, especially at the outset,’ and
that ‘systematical abstraction, if it be introduced into the
teaching without an objective (concrete) preparation, is noxious.’”
M. Leray meant the series of initiations published by the
French publishers, Hachette: <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Initiation mathématique</cite>, by C. A.
Laisant, a book completed by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Initiateur mathématique</i>,
which is a game with small cubes, very ingenious and giving in
a concrete form the proofs of arithmetics, the metric system,
algebra and geometry; <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Initiation astronomique</cite>, by C. Flammarion;
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Initiation chimique</cite>, by Georges Darzens; <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Initiation
à la mécanique</cite>, by Ch. Ed. Guillaume; and <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Initiation zoologique</cite>,
by E. Brucker. The authors of these works had&mdash;it would not
be just not to mention it&mdash;predecessors in Jean Mace’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Arithmétique
du grand-papa</cite>, and René Leblanc, “whose excellent
manual, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Sciences physiques à l’Ecole primaire</cite>”&mdash;M. Leray
says that from his own experience upon pupils from eleven to
thirteen years old&mdash;“gives even to the dullest children the
taste or even the passion for physical experiment.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_191" href="#FNanchor_191" class="label">[191]</a> Take, for instance, the description of Atwood’s machine
in any course of elementary physics. You will find very great
attention paid to the wheels on which the axle of the pulley is
made to lie; hollow boxes, plates and rings, the clock, and
other accessories will be mentioned before one word is said upon
the leading idea of the machine, which is to slacken the motion
of a falling body by making a falling body of small weight move
a heavier body which is in the state of inertia, gravity acting
on it in two opposite directions. That was the inventor’s idea;
and if it is made clear, the pupils see at once that to suspend
two bodies of equal weight over a pulley, and to make them
move by adding a small weight to one of them, is one of the
means (and a good one) for slackening the motion during the
falling; they see that the friction of the pulley must be reduced
to a minimum, either by using the two pairs of wheels, which so
much puzzle the text-book makers, or by any other means;
that the clock is a luxury, and the “plates and rings” are mere
accessories: in short, that Atwood’s idea can be realised with the
wheel of a clock fastened, as a pulley, to a wall, or on the top
of a broomstick secured in a vertical position. In this case the
pupils will understand the <em>idea</em> of the machine and of its inventor,
and they will accustom themselves to separate the leading idea
from the accessories; while in the other case they merely
look with curiosity at the tricks performed by the teacher
with a complicated machine, and the few who finally understand
it spend a quantity of time in the effort. In reality, all
<em>apparatus used to illustrate the fundamental laws of physics
ought to be made by the children themselves</em>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_192" href="#FNanchor_192" class="label">[192]</a> The sale of the pupils’ work was not insignificant, especially
when they reached the higher classes, and made steam-engines.
Therefore the Moscow school, when I knew it, was one of the
cheapest in the world. It gave boarding and education at a
very low fee. But imagine such a school connected with a
farm school, which grows food and exchanges it at its cost
price. What will be the cost of education then?</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_194" href="#FNanchor_194" class="label">[194]</a> The rate of progress in the recently so popular Glacial
Period question was strikingly slow. Already Venetz in 1821
and Esmarck in 1823 had explained the erratic phenomena by
the glaciation of Europe. Agassiz came forth with the glaciation
of the Alps, the Jura mountains, and Scotland, about 1840;
and five years later, Guyot had published his maps of the routes
followed by Alpine boulders. But forty-two years elapsed after
Venetz wrote before one geologist of mark (Lyell) dared timidly
to accept his theory, even to a limited extent&mdash;the most interesting
fact being that Guyot’s maps, considered as irrelevant in 1845,
were recognised as conclusive after 1863. Even now&mdash;more
than half a century after Agassiz’s first work&mdash;Agassiz’s views
are not yet either refuted or generally accepted. So also Forbes’s
views upon the plasticity of ice. Let me add, by the way,
that the whole polemics as to the viscosity of ice is a striking
instance of how facts, scientific terms, and experimental methods
quite familiar to building engineers, were ignored by those
who took part in the polemics. If these facts, terms and
methods were taken into account, the polemics would not have
raged for years with no result. Like instances, to show how
science suffers from a want of acquaintance with facts and
methods of experimenting both well known to engineers, florists,
cattle-breeders, and so on, could be produced in numbers.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_195" href="#FNanchor_195" class="label">[195]</a> Chemistry is, to a great extent, an exception to the rule.
Is it not because the chemist is to such an extent a manual
worker? Besides, during the last ten years we see a decided
revival in scientific inventiveness, especially in physics&mdash;that is,
in a branch in which the engineer and the man of science meet
so much together.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_196" href="#FNanchor_196" class="label">[196]</a> I leave on purpose these lines as they were in the first

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_197" href="#FNanchor_197" class="label">[197]</a> The same remark ought to be made as regards the sociologists,
and still more so the economists. What are most of
them, including the socialists, doing, but studying chiefly the
books previously written and the systems, instead of studying
the <em>facts</em> of the economical life of the nations, and the thousands
of attempts at giving to agriculture and industry new forms of
organisation and new methods, which are now made everywhere
in Europe and America?</p>

<span class="fs70">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">Readers who have had the patience to
follow the facts accumulated in this book,
especially those who have given them a thoughtful
attention, will probably feel convinced of the
immense powers over the productive forces of
Nature that man has acquired within the last
half a century. Comparing the achievements
indicated in this book with the present state of
production, some will, I hope, also ask themselves
the question which will be ere long, let
us hope, the main object of a scientific political
economy: Are the means now in use for satisfying
human needs, under the present system
of permanent division of functions and production
for profits, really <em>economical</em>? Do they
really lead to economy in the expenditure of
human forces? Or, are they not mere wasteful
survivals from a past that was plunged into
darkness, ignorance and oppression, and never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
took into consideration the economical and
social value of the human being?</p>

<p>In the domain of agriculture it may be taken
as proved that if a small part only of the time that
is now given in each nation or region to field
culture was given to well thought out and socially
carried out permanent improvements of the soil,
the duration of work which would be required
afterwards to grow the yearly bread-food for
an average family of five would be less than a
fortnight every year; and that the work required
for that purpose would not be the hard
toil of the ancient slave, but work which would
be agreeable to the physical forces of every
healthy man and woman in the country.</p>

<p>It has been proved that by following the
methods of intensive market-gardening&mdash;partly
under glass&mdash;vegetables and fruit can be grown
in such quantities that men could be provided
with a rich vegetable food and a profusion of
fruit, if they simply devoted to the task of
growing them the hours which everyone willingly
devotes to work in the open air, after having
spent most of his day in the factory, the mine,
or the study. Provided, of course, that the
production of food-stuffs should not be the work
of the isolated individual, but the planned-out
and combined action of human groups.</p>

<p>It has also been proved&mdash;and those who care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
to verify it by themselves may easily do so by
calculating the real expenditure for labour
which was lately made in the building of workmen’s
houses by both private persons and
municipalities<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>&mdash;that under a proper combination
of labour, twenty to twenty-four months of
one man’s work would be sufficient to secure for
ever, for a family of five, an apartment or a
house provided with all the comforts which
modern hygiene and taste could require.</p>

<p>And it has been demonstrated by actual experiment
that, by adopting methods of education,
advocated long since and partially applied here
and there, it is most easy to convey to children
of an average intelligence, before they have
reached the age of fourteen or fifteen, a broad
general comprehension of Nature, as well as of
human societies; to familiarise their minds
with sound methods of both scientific research
and technical work, and inspire their hearts with
a deep feeling of human solidarity and justice;
and that it is extremely easy to convey during
the next four or five years a reasoned, scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
knowledge of Nature’s laws, as well as a knowledge,
at once reasoned and practical, of the
technical methods of satisfying man’s material
needs. Far from being inferior to the “specialised”
young persons manufactured by our universities,
the <em>complete</em> human being, trained to
use his brain and his hands, excels them, on the
contrary, in all respects, especially as an initiator
and an inventor in both science and technics.</p>

<p>All this has been proved. It is an acquisition
of the times we live in&mdash;an acquisition which has
been won despite the innumerable obstacles
always thrown in the way of every initiative
mind. It has been won by the obscure tillers of
the soil, from whose hands greedy States, landlords
and middlemen snatch the fruit of their
labour even before it is ripe; by obscure teachers
who only too often fall crushed under the weight
of Church, State, commercial competition, inertia
of mind and prejudice.</p>

<p>And now, in the presence of all these conquests&mdash;what
is the reality of things?</p>

<p>Nine-tenths of the whole population of grain-exporting
countries like Russia, one-half of it
in countries like France which live on home-grown
food, work upon the land&mdash;most of them
in the same way as the slaves of antiquity did,
only to obtain a meagre crop from a soil, and with
a machinery which they cannot improve, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
taxation, rent and usury keep them always as
near as possible to the margin of starvation. In
this twentieth century, whole populations still
plough with the same plough as their mediæval
ancestors, live in the same incertitude of the
morrow, and are as carefully denied education
as their ancestors; and they have, in claiming
their portion of bread, to march with their
children and wives against their own sons’
bayonets, as their grandfathers did hundreds of
years ago.</p>

<p>In industrially developed countries, a couple
of months’ work, or even much less than that,
would be sufficient to produce for a family a rich
and varied vegetable and animal food. But the
researches of Engel (at Berlin) and his many
followers tell us that the workman’s family has
to spend one full half of its yearly earnings&mdash;that
is, to give six months of labour, and often
more&mdash;to provide its food. And what food!
Is not bread and dripping the staple food of
more than one-half of English children?</p>

<p>One month of work every year would be quite
sufficient to provide the worker with a healthy
dwelling. But it is from 25 to 40 per cent. of
his yearly earnings&mdash;that is, from three to five
months of his working time every year&mdash;that
he has to spend in order to get a dwelling, in
most cases unhealthy and far too small; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>
this dwelling will never be his own, even though
at the age of forty-five or fifty he is sure to be
sent away from the factory, because the work
that he used to do will by that time be accomplished
by a machine and a child.</p>

<p>We all know that the child ought, at least, to
be familiarised with the forces of Nature which
some day he will have to utilise; that he ought
to be prepared to keep pace in his life with the
steady progress of science and technics; that he
ought to study science and learn a trade. Everyone
will grant thus much; but what do we do?
From the age of ten or even nine we send the
child to push a coal-cart in a mine, or to bind,
with a little monkey’s agility, the two ends of
threads broken in a spinning gin. From the
age of thirteen we compel the girl&mdash;a child yet&mdash;to
work as a “woman” at the weaving-loom,
or to stew in the poisoned, over-heated air of a
cotton-dressing factory, or, perhaps, to be poisoned
in the death chambers of a Staffordshire
pottery. As to those who have the relatively
rare luck of receiving some more education, we
crush their minds by useless overtime, we consciously
deprive them of all possibility of themselves
becoming producers; and under an
educational system of which the motive is “profits,”
and the means “specialisation,” we simply
work to death the women teachers who take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
their educational duties in earnest. What floods
of useless sufferings deluge every so-called civilised
land in the world!</p>

<p>When we look back on ages past, and see there
the same sufferings, we may say that perhaps
then they were unavoidable on account of the
ignorance which prevailed. But human genius,
stimulated by our modern Renaissance, has
already indicated new paths to follow.</p>

<p>For thousands of years in succession to grow
one’s food was the burden, almost the curse,
of mankind. But it need be so no more. If
you make yourselves the soil, and partly the
temperature and the moisture which each crop
requires, you will see that to grow the yearly
food of a family, under rational conditions of
culture, requires so little labour that it might
almost be done as a mere change from other
pursuits. If you return to the soil, and co-operate
with your neighbours instead of erecting
high walls to conceal yourself from their looks;
if you utilise what experiment has already
taught us, and call to your aid science and
technical invention, which never fail to answer
to the call&mdash;look only at what they have done for
warfare&mdash;you will be astonished at the facility
with which you can bring a rich and varied food
out of the soil. You will admire the amount
of sound knowledge which your children will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>
acquire by your side, the rapid growth of their
intelligence, and the facility with which they
will grasp the laws of Nature, animate and inanimate.</p>

<p>Have the factory and the workshop at the
gates of your fields and gardens, and work in
them. Not those large establishments, of course,
in which huge masses of metals have to be dealt
with and which are better placed at certain
spots indicated by Nature, but the countless
variety of workshops and factories which are
required to satisfy the infinite diversity of tastes
among civilised men. Not those factories in
which children lose all the appearance of children
in the atmosphere of an industrial hell, but those
airy and hygienic, and consequently economical,
factories in which human life is of more account
than machinery and the making of extra profits,
of which we already find a few samples here and
there; factories and workshops into which men,
women and children will not be driven by
hunger, but will be attracted by the desire of
finding an activity suited to their tastes, and
where, aided by the motor and the machine, they
will choose the branch of activity which best
suits their inclinations.</p>

<p>Let those factories and workshops be erected,
not for making profits by selling shoddy or useless
and noxious things to enslaved Africans, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
to satisfy the unsatisfied needs of millions of
Europeans. And again, you will be struck to
see with what facility and in how short a time
your needs of dress and of thousands of articles
of luxury can be satisfied, when production is
carried on for satisfying real needs rather than
for satisfying shareholders by high profits or for
pouring gold into the pockets of promoters and
bogus directors. Very soon you will yourselves
feel interested in that work, and you will have
occasion to admire in your children their eager
desire to become acquainted with Nature and
its forces, their inquisitive inquiries as to the
powers of machinery, and their rapidly developing
inventive genius.</p>

<p>Such is the future&mdash;already possible, already
realisable; such is the present&mdash;already condemned
and about to disappear. And what
prevents us from turning our backs to this present
and from marching towards that future, or, at
least, making the first steps towards it, is not
the “failure of science,” but first of all our crass
cupidity&mdash;the cupidity of the man who killed
the hen that was laying golden eggs&mdash;and then
our laziness of mind&mdash;that mental cowardice so
carefully nurtured in the past.</p>

<p>For centuries science and so-called practical
wisdom have said to man: “It is good to be
rich, to be able to satisfy, at least, your material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>
needs; but the only means to be rich is to so
train your mind and capacities as to be able to
compel other men&mdash;slaves, serfs or wage-earners&mdash;to
make these riches for you. You have no
choice. Either you must stand in the ranks of
the peasants and the artisans who, whatsoever
economists and moralists may promise them in
the future, are now periodically doomed to
starve after each bad crop or during their strikes,
and to be shot down by their own sons the
moment they lose patience. Or you must train
your faculties so as to be a military commander
of the masses, or to be accepted as one of the
wheels of the governing machinery of the State,
or to become a manager of men in commerce or
industry.” For many centuries there was no
other choice, and men followed that advice,
without finding in it happiness, either for themselves
and their own children, or for those whom
they pretended to preserve from worse misfortunes.</p>

<p>But modern knowledge has another issue to
offer to thinking men. It tells them that in
order to be rich they need not take the bread
from the mouths of others; but that the more
rational outcome would be a society in which
men, with the work of their own hands and intelligence,
and by the aid of the machinery
already invented and to be invented, should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>
themselves create all imaginable riches. Technics
and science will not be lagging behind if
production takes such a direction. Guided by
observation, analysis and experiment, they will
answer all possible demands. They will reduce
the time which is necessary for producing wealth
to any desired amount, so as to leave to everyone
as much leisure as he or she may ask for.
They surely cannot guarantee happiness, because
happiness depends as much, or even more,
upon the individual himself as upon his surroundings.
But they guarantee, at least, the
happiness that can be found in the full and
varied exercise of the different capacities of the
human being, in work that need not be overwork,
and in the consciousness that one is not
endeavouring to base his own happiness upon
the misery of others.</p>

<p>These are the horizons which the above inquiry
opens to the unprejudiced mind.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_198" href="#FNanchor_198" class="label">[198]</a> These figures may be computed, for instance, from the data
contained in “The Ninth Annual Report of the Commissioner of
Labour of the United States, for the year 1893: Building and
Loan Associations.” In this country the cost of a workman’s
cottage is reckoned at about £200, which would represent 700
to 800 days of labour. But we must not forget how much of
this sum is a toll raised by the capitalists and the landlords
upon everything that is used in building the cottage: the bricks
and tiles, the mortar, the wood, the iron, etc.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">The important question as to the amount of British
capital invested in the colonies and in other
countries has only quite lately received due attention.
For the last ten years or so one could find in the
“Reports of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue”
a mention of the revenue derived from British capital
invested in foreign loans to States and Municipalities
and in railway companies; but these returns were
still incomplete. Consequently, Mr. George Paish
made in 1909 and 1911 an attempt at determining these
figures with more accuracy in two papers which he
read before the Statistical Society.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Paish based his researches on the Income Tax,
completing these data by special researches about
private investments, which do not appear in the
Income Tax returns. He has not yet got to the end
of his investigation; but, all taken, he estimates that
the yearly income received by this country from abroad
from different sources reaches £300,000,000 every year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span></p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_B">B.&mdash;FRENCH IMPORTS.</h3>

<p>About one-tenth part of the cereals consumed in
France is still imported; but, as will be seen in a
subsequent chapter, the progress in agriculture has
lately been so rapid that even without Algeria France
will soon have a surplus of cereals. Wine is imported,
but nearly as much is exported. So that coffee and
oil-seeds remain the only food articles of durable importance
for import. For coal and coke France is still
tributary to Belgium, to this country, and to Germany;
but it is chiefly the inferiority of organisation of coal
extraction which stands in the way of the home supply.
The other important items of imports are: raw cotton
(from £12,440,000 to £18,040,000 in 1903-1910), raw
wool (from £15,160,000 to £23,200,000), and raw silk
(from £10,680,000 to £17,640,000), as well as hides and
furs, oil-seeds, and machinery (about £10,000,000).
The exports of manufactured goods were £80,000,000
in 1890, and in subsequent years from £119,000,000
to £137,000,000. Exports of textiles, exclusive of yarn
and linen, £29,800,000 in 1890, and £34,440,000 in
1908-1910; while the imports of all textiles are insignificant
(from £5,000,000 to £7,000,000).</p>

<p>The recent growth of the coal and iron industries in
South Russia (with the aid of Belgian capital) was very
well illustrated at the Turin Exhibition of 1911. From
less than 100,000 tons in 1860, the extraction of coal and
anthracite rose to 16,840,460 metric tons in 1910. The
extraction of iron ore rose from 377,000 tons in 1890
to 3,760,000 tons in 1909. The production of cast iron,
which was only 29,270 tons in 1882, reached 2,067,000
tons in 1910, and the amount of refined iron and steel and
their produce rose from 27,830 tons in 1882 to 1,641,960
tons in 1910. In short, South Russia is becoming an
exporting centre for the iron industry. (P. Palcinsky,

called attention to the fact that Germany had certainly
not yet attained, in her cotton industry, the high
technical level of development attained by England;
but he showed also the progress realised. The cost
of each yard of plain cotton, notwithstanding low wages
and long hours, was still greater in Germany than in
England, as seen from the following tables. Taking a
certain quality of plain cotton in both countries, he
gave (p. 151, German edition) the following comparative

<p>It is evident that considerable progress has been
realised since Schulze-Gaewernitz wrote these lines.
As an exporter of cotton yarn and cottons, Germany
has made rapid strides. Thus, in 1903, she exported
£1,625,000 worth of cotton yarn, and £15,080,000
worth of cottons. For 1910 the figures given by the

<p>At the present time the exports of coal entirely
balance the imports.</p>

<p>As to the textile industries, the imports of raw
cotton into Austria-Hungary reached in 1907 the
respectable value of £12,053,400. For raw wool and
wool yarn they were £6,055,600 worth, and for silk,
£1,572,000; while £3,156,200 worth of woollens were
exported.</p>

<p>According to the census of 1902 (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Statistisches Jahrbuch
for 1911</cite>), there were already, in Austria-Hungary,
1,408,855 industrial establishments, occupying 4,049,320
workpeople, and having a machinery representing
1,787,900 horse-power. The textile trades alone had
in their service 257,500 horse-power (as against 113,280
in 1890).</p>

<p>The small industry evidently prevailed, nearly one-half
of all the workpeople (2,066,120) being employed
in 901,202 establishments, which had only from one
to twenty persons each; while 443,235 workpeople
were employed in 10,661 establishments (from twenty-one
to 100 workpeople each). Still, the great industry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span>
has already made its appearance in some branches&mdash;there
being 3,021 establishments which employed
more than 100 workers each, and representing an
aggregate of 1,053,790 workpeople. Out of them
105 establishments employed even more than 1,000
persons each (115 establishments, 179,876 workpeople
in 1910).</p>

<p>In Hungary industry is also rapidly developing; it
occupied 1,127,130 persons in 1902 (34,160 in the textiles,
and 74,000 in mining). In 1910 the exports of all
textiles (stuffs and yarns) from Hungary reached the
sum of £7,040,500.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_H">H.&mdash;COTTON MANUFACTURE IN INDIA.</h3>

<p>The views taken in the text about the industrial
development of India are confirmed by a mass of
evidence. One of them, coming from authorised
quarters, deserves special attention. In an article on
the progress of the Indian cotton manufacture, the
<cite>Textile Recorder</cite> (15th October, 1888) wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>“No person connected with the cotton industry can
be ignorant of the rapid progress of the cotton manufacture
in India. Statistics of all kinds have recently
been brought before the public, showing the increase
of production in the country; still it does not seem
to be clearly understood that this increasing output of
cotton goods must seriously lower the demand upon
Lancashire mills, and that it is not by any means
improbable that India may at no very distant period
be no better customer than the United States is
now.”</p>

<p>One hardly need add at what price the Indian
manufacturers obtain cheap cottons. The report of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span>
the Bombay Factory Commission which was laid
before Parliament in August, 1888, contained facts
of such horrible cruelty and cupidity as would hardly
be imagined by those who have forgotten the disclosures
of the inquiry made in this country in 1840-1842.
The factory engines are at work, as a rule, from
5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> till 7, 8, or 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and the workers remain at
work for twelve, thirteen, fourteen hours, only releasing
one another for meals. In busy times it
happens that the same set of workers remain at the
gins and presses night and day with half an hour’s
rest in the evening. In some factories the workers
have their meals at the gins, and are so worn out
after eight and ten days’ uninterrupted work
that they supply the gins mechanically “three parts
asleep.”</p>

<p>“It is a sad tale of great want on one side, and
cruel cupidity on the other,” the official report concludes.
However, it would be absolutely erroneous
to conclude that Indian manufactures can compete
with the British ones as long as they continue the
terrible exploitation of human labour which we see
now. Forty years ago the British manufactures
offered absolutely the same terrible picture of cruel
cupidity. But times will come when Indian workers
will restrain the cupidity of the capitalists, and the
manufacturers of Bombay will be none the worse for
that in their competition with the British manufactures.</p>

<p>The figures relative to the latest growth of the
textile industries in India, given in the text, fully
confirm the previsions expressed twenty-five years
ago. As to the conditions of the workpeople in
the Indian cotton-mills, they continue to remain
abominable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span></p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_I">I.&mdash;THE COTTON INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>A few years ago the cotton industry in the United
States attracted the attention of the Manchester
cotton manufacturers, and we have now two very
interesting works written by persons who went specially
to the States in order to study the rapid progress made
there in spinning and weaving.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>These two inquiries fully confirm what has been
said in the text of this book about the rapid progress
made in the American industry altogether, and especially
in the development of a very fine cotton-weaving
machinery. In his preface to Mr. Young’s
book, Mr. Helm says: “The results of this inquiry
may not incorrectly be called a revelation for Lancashire.
It was, indeed, already known to a few on this
side of the ocean that there were wide differences
between the methods and organisation of American and
English cotton-mills. But it is only between the last
three or four years that suspicion has arisen amongst
us that our competitors in the United States have been
marching faster than we have in the path of economy
of production.”</p>

<p>The most important difference between the British
and American methods was, in Mr. Helm’s opinion,
in “the extensive use of the automatic loom.” Mr.
Young’s investigation on the subject left no doubts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span>
that the employment of this loom “substantially reduces
the cost of production, and at the same time increases
the earnings of the weaver, because it permits
him to conduct more looms” (p. 15). Altogether, we
learn from Mr. Helm’s remarks that there are now
85,000 automatic looms running in the United States,
and that “the demand for weavers is greater than
ever” (p. 16). In a Rhode Island mill, 743 ordinary
looms required 100 weavers, while 2,000 Northrop
(or Draper) looms could be conducted by 134 weavers
only, which means an average of fifteen looms for
each weaver. At Burlington, Vermont, from sixteen
to twenty Northrop looms were conducted by each
weaver, and altogether these looms are spreading
very rapidly. But it is not only in the looms that
such improvements have been introduced. “The
spinning frames,” we are told by Mr. Young, “containing
112 spindles a side, were tended by girls
who ran four, six, eight, or ten sides each, according
to the girl’s dexterity. The average for
good spinners was about eight sides (896 spindles)”
(p. 10).</p>

<p>In a New Bedford fine-spinning mill the ring-spinners
were minding 1,200 spindles each (p. 16).</p>

<p>It is also important to note the speed at which the
cotton industry has been developing lately in the
States. The census of 1900 gave a total of 19,008,350
spindles. But in 1909 we find already 28,178,860
spindles for cotton alone (34,500,000, including silk,
wool, and worsted). And, what is still more important,
most of this increase fell upon the Southern States,
where machinery is also more perfect, both for spinning
and weaving, and where most of the work is being
done by the whites. In a South Carolina print-cloth
mill, containing 1,000 Draper looms, the average for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span>
narrow looms was 15½ looms to each weaver. (T. W.
Uttley, <em>l.c.</em>, pp. 4, 50, etc.)</p>

<p>As for the American competition in the Chinese
markets, Mr. Helm gives imposing figures.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_J">J.&mdash;MR. GIFFEN’S AND MR. FLUX’S FIGURES
CONCERNING THE POSITION OF THE
UNITED KINGDOM IN INTERNATIONAL
TRADE.</h3>

<p>A few remarks concerning these figures may be of
some avail.</p>

<p>When a sudden fall in the British and Irish exports
took place in the years 1882-1886, and the alarmists
took advantage of the bad times to raise the never-forgotten
war-cry of protection, especially insisting on
the damages made to British trade by “German
competition,” Mr. Giffen analysed the figures of international
trade in his “Finance Essays,” and in a
report read in 1888 before the Board of Trade Commission.
Subsequently, Mr. A. W. Flux analysed
again the same figures, extending them to a later
period. He confirmed Mr. Giffen’s conclusions and endeavoured
to prove that the famous “German competition”
is a fallacy.</p>

<p>Mr. Giffen’s conclusions, quoted by Mr. A. W. Flux
(“The Commercial Supremacy of Great Britain,” in
<cite>Economical Journal</cite>, 1894, iv., p. 457), were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On the whole, the figures are not such as to indicate
any great and overwhelming advance in German
exports, in comparison with those of the United
Kingdom. There is greater progress in certain directions,
but, taken altogether, no great disproportionate
advance, and in many important markets for the
United Kingdom Germany hardly appears at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span></p>

<p>In this subdued form, <em>with regard to German competition
alone</em>&mdash;and due allowance being made for
figures in which no consideration is given to what
sort of goods make a given value of exports, and in
what quantities&mdash;Mr. Giffen’s statement could be
accepted. But that was all.</p>

<p>If we take, however, Mr. Giffen’s figures as they are
reproduced in extended tables (on pp. 461-467 of the
just quoted paper), tabulated with great pains in order
to show that Germany’s part in the imports to several
European countries, such as Russia, Italy, Servia, etc.,
had declined, as well as the part of the United Kingdom,
all we could conclude from these figures was, that there
were other countries besides Germany&mdash;namely, the
United States and Belgium&mdash;which competed very
effectively with England, France, and Germany for
supplying what manufactured goods were taken by
Russia, Italy, Servia, etc., from abroad.</p>

<p>At the same time such figures gave no idea of the
fact that where manufactured metal goods were
formerly supplied, coal and raw metals were imported
for the home manufacture of those same goods; or,
where dyed and printed cottons were imported, only
yarn was required. The whole subject is infinitely
more complicated than it appeared in Mr. Giffen’s
calculations; and, valuable as his figures may have
been for appeasing exaggerated fears, they contained
no answer whatever to the many economic questions
involved in the matters treated by Mr. Giffen.</p>

<p>The conclusions which I came to in these lines in the
first edition of this book found further confirmation in
the subsequent economical development of all nations
in that same direction. The result is, that&mdash;apart
from the extraordinary exports of the years 1910 and
1911 (which I venture to explain by the general pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span>vision
of a great European war going to break out)&mdash;the
exports from this country, apart from their usual
periodical fluctuations, continued to remain what they
were, in proportion to the increasing population, and
many of them became less profitable; while the
exports from all other countries increased in a much
greater proportion.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_K">K.&mdash;MARKET-GARDENING IN BELGIUM.</h3>

<p>In 1885 the superficies given to market gardening in
Belgium was 99,600 acres. In 1894 a Belgian professor
of agriculture, who has kindly supplied me with notes
on this subject, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The area has considerably increased, and I believe
it can be taken at 112,000 acres (45,000 hectares), if not
more.” And further on: “Rents in the neighbourhood
of the big towns, Antwerp, Liège, Ghent, and
Brussels, attain as much as £5, 16s. and £8 per acre;
the cost of instalment is from £13 to £25 per acre;
the yearly cost of manure, which is the chief expense,
attains from £8 to £16 per acre the first year, and then
from £5 to £8 every year.” The gardens are of the
average size of two and a half acres, and in each
garden from 200 to 400 frames are used. About the
Belgian market-gardeners the same remark must
be made as has been made concerning the French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîchers</i>. They work awfully hard, having to pay
extravagant rents, and to lay money aside, with the
hope of some day being able to buy a piece of land,
and to get rid of the blood-sucker who absorbs so
much of their money returns; having moreover every
year to buy more and more frames in order to obtain
their produce earlier and earlier, so as to fetch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span>
higher prices for it, they work like slaves. But it
must be remembered that in order to obtain the same
amount of produce under glass, in greenhouses, the
work of <em>three men only</em>, working fifty-five hours a week,
is required in Jersey for cultivating one acre of land
under glass.</p>

<p>But I must refer my readers to the excellent work
of my friend, B. Seebohm Rowntree’s <cite>Land and Labour:
Lessons from Belgium</cite>, London (Macmillan), 1910, a
strong volume of more than 600 pages, which is the
result of several years of laborious studies. It is full
of figures and personal observations, and will be consulted
with advantage for all the questions dealing
with the economical life of Belgium.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_L">L.&mdash;THE CHANNEL ISLANDS&mdash;THE SCILLY ISLANDS.</h3>

<p>The excellent state of agriculture in Jersey and
Guernsey has often been mentioned in the agricultural
and general literature of this country, so I need only
refer to the works of Mr. W. E. Bear (<cite>Journal of the
Agricultural Society</cite>, 1888; <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, 1888;
<cite>British Farmer</cite>, etc.) and to the exhaustive work of
D. H. Ansted and R. G. Latham, <cite>The Channel Islands</cite>,
third edition, revised by E. Toulmin Nicolle, London
(Allen), 1893.</p>

<p>Many English writers&mdash;certainly not those just
named&mdash;are inclined to explain the successes obtained
in Jersey by the wonderful climate of the islands and
the fertility of the soil. As to climate, it is certainly
true that the yearly record of sunshine in Jersey is
greater than in any English station. It reaches from
1,842 hours a year (1890) to 2,300 (1893), and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span>
exceeds the highest aggregate sunshine recorded in
any English station by from 168 to 336 hours (exclusively
high maximum in 1894) a year; May and
August seeming to be the best favoured months.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
But, to quote from the just mentioned work of Ansted
and Latham:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is, doubtless, in all the islands, and especially
in Guernsey, <em>an absence of sun heat</em> and of the
direct action of the sun’s rays <em>in summer</em>, which must
have its effect, and <em>a remarkable prevalence of cold, dry,
east wind in late spring, retarding vegetation</em>” (p. 407).
Everyone who has spent, be it only two or three
weeks in late spring in Jersey, must know by experience
how true this remark is. Moreover, there are
the well-known Guernsey fogs, and “owing also to
rain and damp the trees suffer from mildew and
blight, as well as from various aphides.” The same
authors remark that the nectarine does not succeed
in Jersey in the open air “owing to the absence of
autumn heat”; that “the wet autumns and cold
summers do not agree with the apricot;” and so on.</p>

<p>If Jersey potatoes are, on the average, three weeks
in advance of those grown in Cornwall, the fact is fully
explained by the continual improvements made in
Jersey in view of obtaining, be it ever so small, quantities
of potatoes a few days in advance, either by
special care taken to plant them out as soon as possible,
protecting them from the cold winds, or by
choosing tiny pieces of land naturally protected or
better exposed. The difference in price between the
earliest and the later potatoes being immense, the
greatest efforts are made to obtain an early crop.</p>

<p>The decline of prices per ton is best seen from the
following prices in 1910:&mdash;</p>

<p>The quantities of early potatoes exported varied
during the years 1901 to 1910 from 47,530 tons to
77,800 tons, and their value from £233,289 to £475,889.</p>

<p>As to the fertility of the soil, it is still worse advocacy,
because there is no area in the United Kingdom
of equal size which would be manured to such an
extent as the area of Jersey and Guernsey is by means
of artificial manure. In the seventeenth century, as
may be seen from the first edition of Falle’s <cite>Jersey</cite>,
published in 1694, the island “did not produce that
quantity as is necessary for the use of the inhabitants,
who must be supplied from England in time of peace,
or from Dantzic in Poland.” In <cite>The Groans of the
Inhabitants of Jersey</cite>, published in London in 1709,
we find the same complaint. And Quayle, who wrote
in 1812 and quoted the two works just mentioned,
in his turn complained in these terms: “The quantity
at this day raised is quite inadequate to their
sustenance, apart from the garrison.” (<cite>General View
of the Agriculture and the Present State of the Islands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span>
on the Coast of Normandy</cite>, London, 1815, p. 77.) And
he added: “After making all allowance, the truth
must be told; the grain crops are here foul, in some
instances execrably so.” And when we consult the
modern writers, Ansted, Latham, and Nicolle, we
learn that the soil is by no means rich. It is decomposed
granite, and easily cultivable, but “it contains
no organic matter besides what man has put into it.”</p>

<p>This is certainly the opinion anyone will come to
if he only visits thoroughly the island and looks attentively
to its soil&mdash;to say nothing of the Quenvais
where, in Quayle’s time, there was “an Arabian desert”
of sands and hillocks covering about seventy acres
(p. 24), with a little better but still very poor soil in
the north and west of it. The fertility of the soil
has entirely been made, first, by the <em>vraic</em> (sea-weeds),
upon which the inhabitants have maintained communal
rights; later on, by considerable shipments of
manure, in addition to the manure of the very considerable
living stock which is kept in the island; and
finally, by an admirably good cultivation of the soil.</p>

<p>Much more than sunshine and good soil, it was the
conditions of land-tenure and the low taxation which
contributed to the remarkable development of agriculture
in Jersey. First of all, the people of the Isles
know but little of the tax-collector. While the English
pay, in taxes, an average of 50s. per head of population;
while the French peasant is over-burdened with taxes
of all imaginable descriptions; and the Milanese peasant
has to give to the Treasury full 30 per cent. of his income&mdash;all
taxes paid in the Channel Islands amount to but
10s. per head in the town parishes and to much less than
that in the country parishes. Besides, of indirect taxes,
none are known but the 2s. 6d. paid for each gallon of
imported spirits and 9d. per gallon of imported wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span></p>

<p>As to the conditions of land-tenure, the inhabitants
have happily escaped the action of Roman Law, and
they continue to live under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coutumier de Normandie</i>
(the old Norman common law). Accordingly, more
than one-half of the territory is owned by those who
themselves till the soil; there is no landlord to watch
the crops and to raise the rent before the farmer has
ripened the fruit of his improvements; there is nobody
to charge so much for each cart-load of sea-weeds or
sand taken to the fields; everyone takes the amount
he likes, provided he cuts the weeds at a certain
season of the year, and digs out the sand at a distance
of sixty yards from the high-water mark. Those who
buy land for cultivation can do so without becoming
enslaved to the money-lender. One-fourth part only
of the permanent rent which the purchaser undertakes
to pay is capitalised and has to be paid down on purchase
(often less than that), the remainder being a
perpetual rent in wheat which is valued in Jersey at
fifty to fifty-four <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous de France</i> per cabot. To seize
property for debt is accompanied with such difficulties
that it is seldom resorted to (Quayle’s <cite>General View</cite>,
pp. 41-46). Conveyances of land are simply acknowledged
by both parties on oath, and cost nearly nothing.
And the laws of inheritance are such as to preserve
the homestead, notwithstanding the debts that the
father may have run into (<em>ibid.</em>, pp. 35-41).</p>

<p>After having shown how small are the farms in the
islands (from twenty to five acres, and very many less
than that)&mdash;there being “less than 100 farms in either
island that exceed twenty-five acres; and of these
only about half a dozen in Jersey exceed fifty acres”&mdash;Messrs.
Ansted, Latham, and Nicolle remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In no place do we find so happy and so contented
a country as in the Channel Islands....” “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span>
system of land-tenure has also contributed in no small
degree to their prosperity....” “The purchaser
becomes the absolute owner of the property, and his
position cannot be touched so long as the interest of
these [wheat] rents be paid. He cannot be compelled,
as in the case of mortgage, to refund the principal. <em>The
advantages of such a system are too patent to need any
further allusion.</em>” (<cite>The Channel Islands</cite>, third edition,
revised by E. Toulmin Nicolle, p. 401; see also p. 443.)</p>

<p>The following will better show how the cultivable
area is utilised in Jersey (<cite>The Evening Post Royal
Almanack</cite>):&mdash;</p>

<p>The export value <em>per acre</em> varied in different years
from £27, 6s. in 1893 to £66, 1s. in 1894, and even
£95, 18s. in 1904.</p>

<p>As regards greenhouse culture, a friend of mine, who
has worked as a gardener in Jersey, has collected for
me various information relative to the productivity
of culture under glass. Out of it the following may
be taken as a perfectly reliable illustration, in addition
to those given in the text:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. B.’s greenhouse has a length of 300 feet and a
width of 18 feet, which makes 5,400 square feet, out of
which 900 square feet are under the passage in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span>
middle. The cultivable area is thus 4,500 square feet.
There are no brick walls, but brick pillars and boards
are used for front walls. Hot-water heating is provided,
but is only used occasionally, to keep off the
frosts in winter&mdash;the crops being early potatoes (which
require no heating), followed by tomatoes. The latter
are Mr. B.’s speciality. Catch crops of radishes, etc.,
are taken. The cost of the greenhouse, without the heating
apparatus, is 10s. per running foot of greenhouse,
which makes £150 for one-eighth of an acre under glass,
or a little less than 7d. per glass-roofed square foot.</p>

<p>The crops are: potatoes, four cabots per perch&mdash;that
is, three-quarters of a ton of early potatoes from
the greenhouse; and tomatoes, in the culture of
which Mr. B. attains extraordinary results. He puts
in only 1,000 plants, thus giving to his plants more
room than is usually given; and he cultivates a corrugated
variety which gives very heavy crops but does
not fetch the same prices as the smooth varieties.
In 1896 his crop was four tons of tomatoes, and so it
would have been in 1897&mdash;each plant giving an average
of twenty pounds of fruit, while the usual crop is from
eight to twelve pounds per plant.</p>

<p>The total crop was thus four and three-quarter tons
of vegetables, to which the catch crops must be added&mdash;thus
corresponding to 85,000 lb. per acre (over
90,000 lb. with the catch crops). I again omit the
money returns, and only mention that the expenditure
for fuel and manure was about £10 a year, and
that the Jersey average is three men, each working
fifty-five hours a week (ten hours a day), for every acre
under glass.</p>

<p><em>The Scilly Islands.</em>&mdash;These islands also give a beautiful
illustration of what may be obtained from the
soil by an intensive cultivation. When shipping and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span>
supplying pilots became a decaying source of income,
the Scillonians took to the growing of potatoes. For
many years, we are told by Mr. J. G. Uren (<cite>Scilly and
the Scillonians</cite>, Plymouth, 1907), this was a very
profitable industry. The crop was ready at least a
month in advance of any other source of supply on
the mainland. Every year about 1,000 tons of potatoes
were exported. “In its palmy days the potato harvest
in Scilly was the great event of the year. Gangs of
diggers were brought across from the mainland,” and
the prices went occasionally up to £28 a ton for the
earliest potatoes. Gradually, however, the export of
potatoes was reduced to less than one-half of what it
was formerly. Then the inhabitants of the islands
went for fishing, and later on they began to grow
flowers. Frost and snow being practically unknown in
the islands, this new industry succeeded very well. The
arable area of the islands is about 4,000 acres, which
are divided into small farms, less than from fifteen
to twenty acres, and these farms are transmitted,
according to the local custom, from father to son.</p>

<p>It is not long ago that they began to grow wild narcissuses,
to which they soon added daffodils (a hundred
varieties), and lilies, especially arum-lilies, for Church
decoration. All these are grown in narrow strips,
sheltered from the winds by dwarf hedges. Movable
glass-houses are resorted to shelter the flowers for a
certain time, and in this way the gardeners have a
succession of crops, beginning soon after Christmas,
and lasting until April or May.</p>

<p>The flowers are shipped to Penzance, and thence
carried by rail in special carriages. At the top of the
season thirty to forty tons are shipped in a single
day. The total exports, which were only 100 tons in
1887, have now reached 1,000 in 1907.</p>

<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_M">M.&mdash;IRRIGATED MEADOWS IN ITALY.</h3>

<p>In the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de l’Agriculture</cite> (2nd Feb., 1889) the
following was said about the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marcites</i> of Milan:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On part of these meadows water runs constantly,
on others it is left running for ten hours every week.
The former give six crops every year; since February,
eighty to 100 tons of grass, equivalent to twenty and
twenty-five tons of dry hay, being obtained from the
hectare (eight to ten tons per acre). Lower down,
thirteen tons of dry hay per acre is the regular crop.
Taking eighty acres placed in average conditions, they
will yield fifty-six tons of green grass per hectare&mdash;that
is, fourteen tons of dry hay, or the food of three milch
cows to the hectare (two and a half acres). The rent
of such meadows is from £8 to £9, 12s. per acre.”</p>

<p>For Indian corn, the advantages of irrigation are
equally apparent. On irrigated lands, crops of from
seventy-eight to eighty-nine bushels per acre are obtained,
as against from fifty-six to sixty-seven bushels
on unirrigated lands, also in Italy, and twenty-eight
to thirty-three bushels in France (Garola, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Céréales</cite>).</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_N">N.&mdash;PLANTED WHEAT.</h3>

<p><em>The Rothamsted Challenge.</em></p>

<p>Sir A. Cotton delivered, in 1893, before the Balloon
Society, a lecture on agriculture, in which lecture he
warmly advocated deep cultivation and planting the
seeds of wheat wide apart. He published it later on
as a pamphlet (<cite>Lecture on Agriculture</cite>, 2nd edition,
with Appendix. Dorking, 1893). He obtained, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span>
best of his sort of wheat, an average of “fifty-five ears
per plant, with three oz. of grain of fair quality&mdash;perhaps
sixty-three lbs. per bushel” (p. 10). This
corresponded to ninety bushels per acre&mdash;that is, his
result was very similar to those obtained at the Tomblaine
and Capelle agricultural stations by Grandeau
and F. Dessprèz, whose work seems not to have been
known to Sir A. Cotton. True, Sir A. Cotton’s experiments
were not conducted, or rather were not
reported, in a thoroughly scientific way. But the
more desirable it would have been, either to contradict
or to confirm his statements by experiments carefully
conducted at some experimental agricultural station.
Unfortunately, so far as I know, no such experiments
have yet been made, and the possibility of profitably
increasing the wheat crop by the means indicated by
Sir A. Cotton has still to be tested in a scientific
spirit.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_O">O.&mdash;REPLANTED WHEAT.</h3>

<p>A few words on this method which now claims the
attention of the experimental stations may perhaps
not be useless.</p>

<p>In Japan, rice is always treated in this way. It is
treated as our gardeners treat lettuce and cabbage&mdash;that
is, it is let first to germinate; then it is sown in
special warm corners, well inundated with water and
protected from the birds by strings drawn over the
ground. Thirty-five to fifty-five days later, the young
plants, now fully developed and possessed of a thick
network of rootlets, are <em>replanted</em> in the open ground.
In this way the Japanese obtain from twenty to thirty-two
bushels of <em>dressed</em> rice to the acre in the poor
provinces, forty bushels in the better ones, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span>
sixty to sixty-seven bushels on the best lands. The
average, in six rice growing states of North America,
is at the same time only nine and a half bushels.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>In China, replanting is also in general use, and consequently
the idea has been circulated in France by
M. Eugène Simon and the late M. Toubeau, that
replanted wheat could be made a powerful means of
increasing the crops in Western Europe.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> So far as
I know, the idea has not yet been submitted to a
practical test; but when one thinks of the remarkable
results obtained by Hallet’s method of planting; of
what the market-gardeners obtain by replanting once
and even twice; and of how rapidly the work of
planting is done by market-gardeners in Jersey, one
must agree that in replanted wheat we have a new
opening worthy of the most careful consideration.
Experiments have not yet been made in this direction;
but Prof. Grandeau, whose opinion I have asked on
this subject, wrote to me that he believes the method
must have a great future. Practical market-gardeners
(Paris <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maraîcher</i>) whose opinion I have asked, see, of
course, nothing extravagant in that idea.</p>

<p>With plants yielding 1,000 grains each&mdash;and in the
Capelle experiment they yielded an average of 600
grains&mdash;the yearly wheat-food of one individual man
(5·65 bushels, or 265 lbs.), which is represented by from
5,000,000 to 5,500,000 grains, could be grown on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span>
space of 250 square yards; while for an experienced
hand replanting would represent no more than ten to
twelve hours’ work. With a proper machine-tool,
the work could probably be very much reduced. In
Japan, two men and two women plant with rice
three-quarters of an acre in one day (Ronna, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
Irrigations</cite>, vol. iii., 1890, p. 67 seq.). That means
(Fesca, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Japanesische Landwirthschaft</cite>, p. 33) from
33,000 to 66,000 plants, or, let us say, a minimum of
8,250 plants a day for one person. The Jersey gardeners
plant from 600 (inexperienced) to 1,000 plants
per hour (experienced).</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_P">P.&mdash;IMPORTS OF VEGETABLES TO THE UNITED KINGDOM.</h3>

<p>That the land in this country is not sufficiently utilised
for market-gardening, and that the largest portion of
the vegetables which are imported from abroad could
be grown in this country, has been said over and over
again within the last twenty-five years.</p>

<p>It is certain that considerable improvements have
taken place lately&mdash;the area under market-gardens,
and especially the area under glass for the growth of
fruit and vegetables, having largely been increased of
late. Thus, instead of 38,957 acres, which were given
to market-gardening in Great Britain in 1875, there
were, in 1894, 88,210 acres, exclusive of vegetable
crops on farms, given to that purpose (<cite>The Gardener’s
Chronicle</cite>, 20th April, 1895, p. 483). But that increase
remains a trifle in comparison with similar increases
in France, Belgium, and the United States. In
France, the area given to market-gardening was estimated
in 1892 by M. Baltet (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’horticulture dans les<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span>
cinq parties du monde</cite>, Paris, Hachette, 1895) at
1,075,000 acres&mdash;four times more, in proportion to
the cultivable area, than in this country; and the
most remarkable of it is that considerable tracts of
land formerly treated as uncultivable have been reclaimed
for the purposes of market-gardening as also
of fruit growing.</p>

<p>As things stand now in this country, we see that very
large quantities of the commonest vegetables, each of
which could be grown in this country, are imported.</p>

<p>Lettuces are imported&mdash;not only from the Azores or
from the south of France, but they continue until
June to be imported from France, where they are
mostly grown&mdash;not in the open air, but in frames.
Early cucumbers, also grown in frames, are largely
imported from Holland, and are sold so cheaply that
many English gardeners have ceased to grow them.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
Even beetroot and pickling cabbage are imported
from Holland and Brittany (the neighbourhoods of
Saint Malo, where I saw them grown in a sandy soil,
which would grow nothing without a heavy manuring
with guano, as a second crop, after a first one of potatoes);
and while onions were formerly largely grown
in this country, we see that, in 1894, 5,288,512 bushels
of onions, £765,049 worth, were imported from Belgium
(chief exporter), Germany, Holland, France, and so on.</p>

<p>Again, that early potatoes should be imported from
the Azores and the south of France is quite natural.
It is not so natural, however, that more than 50,000
tons of potatoes (58,060 tons, £521,141 worth, on the
average during the years 1891-1894) should be imported
from the Channel Islands, because there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span>
hundreds if not thousands of acres in South Devon,
and most probably in other parts of the south coast
too, where early potatoes could be grown equally well.
But besides the 90,000 tons of early potatoes (over
£700,000 worth) which are imported to this country,
enormous quantities of late potatoes are imported
from Holland, Germany, and Belgium; so that the
total imports of potatoes reach from 200,000 to 450,000
tons every year. Moreover, this country imports every
year all sorts of green vegetables, for the sum of at
least £4,000,000, and for £5,000,000 all sorts of fruit
(apart from exotic fruit); while thousands of acres lie
idle, and the country population is driven to the
cities in search of work, without finding it.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_Q">Q.&mdash;FRUIT-CULTURE IN BELGIUM.</h3>

<p>It appears from the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annuaire statistique de la belgique</cite>
that, out of a cultivated area of 6,443,500 acres, the
following areas were given in Belgium, at the time
of the last census, to fruit-growing, market-gardening,
and culture under glass: Orchards, 117,600 acres;
market-gardens, 103,460 acres; vineries, 173 acres
(increased since); growing of trees for afforestation,
gardens, and orchards, 7,475 acres; potatoes, 456,000
acres. Consequently, Belgium is able to export every
year about £250,000 worth more vegetables, and nearly
£500,000 worth more fruit, than she imports. As to the
vineries, the land of the communes of Hoeylart and
Overyssche near Brussels is almost entirely covered with
glass, and the exports of home-grown grapes attained,
in 1910, 6,800 tons, in addition to 34,000 tons of other
home-grown fruit. Besides, nearly 3,000 acres in the
environs of Ghent are covered with horticultural estab<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span>lishments
which export palms, azaleas, rhododendrons,
and laurels all over the world, including Italy and the
Argentine.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_R">R.&mdash;CULTURE UNDER GLASS IN HOLLAND.</h3>

<p>Holland in its turn has introduced gardening in
hothouses on a great scale. Here is a letter which I
received in the summer of 1909 from a friend:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Here is a picture-postcard which J. (a professor
of botany in Belgium) has brought from Holland, and
which he asks me to send you. [The postcard represents
an immense space covered with frames and
glass lights.] Similar establishments cover many
square kilomètres between Rotterdam and the sea,
in the north of Heuve. At the time when J. was
there (June 10) they had cucumbers, quite ripe, and
melons as big as a head in considerable numbers,
exported abroad. The cultures are made to a great
extent without heating. The gardeners sow also
radishes, carrots, lettuce, under the same glass. The
different produce comes one after the other. They also
cultivate large quantities of strawberries in frames.</p>

<p>“The glass-frames are transported at will, so as to
keep under glass for several days or weeks the plants
sown in any part of the garden. J. is full of admiration
for the knowledge of the gardeners. Instead of
the usual routine, they apply the last progress of
science. He was told that glass is broken very seldom;
they have acquired the art of handling glass-frames
with facility and great skill.</p>

<p>“Besides the frames represented on the photograph,
the region between Rotterdam and the sea, which
is named Westland, has also countless glass-houses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span>
where they cultivate, with or without heating, grapes,
peaches, northern cherries, haricot beans, tomatoes,
and other fruit and vegetables. These cultures have
reached a very high degree of perfection. The gardeners
take the greatest care to fight various plant
diseases. They also cultivate ordinary fruit&mdash;apples,
pears, gooseberries, strawberries, and so on&mdash;and
vegetables in the open air. Westland being very
much exposed to strong winds, they have built
numerous walls, which break the wind, and serve at
the same time for the culture of fruit upon the walls.</p>

<p>“All the region feels the favourable influence of the
agricultural school of Naaldwijk, which is situated
almost in the centre of the Westland.”</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_S">S.&mdash;PRICES OBTAINED IN LONDON FOR DESSERT
GRAPES CULTIVATED UNDER GLASS.</h3>

<p><cite>The Fruit and Market-Gardener</cite> gives every week the
prices realised by horticultural and intensive gardening
produce, as well as by flowers, at the great market
of Covent Garden. The prices obtained for dessert
grapes&mdash;Colmar and Hamburg&mdash;are very instructive.
I took two years&mdash;1907-1908&mdash;which differ from
ordinary years by the winters having been foggy,
which made the garden produce to be somewhat late.</p>

<p>In the first days of January the Colmar grapes
arriving from the Belgian hothouses were still sold
at relatively low prices&mdash;from 6d. to 10d. the pound.
But the prices slowly rose in January and February;
the Hamburg grapes were late that year, and therefore
in the middle of March and later on in April
the Colmars fetched from 1s. 6d. to 2s. 6d.</p>

<p>The English grapes, coming from Worthing and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[452]</span>
on, are certainly preferred to those that come from
Belgium or the Channel Islands. By the end of April,
1907, and at the beginning of May, they were even sold
at 2s. and 4s. the pound. The best and largest grapes
for the dinners are evidently fetching fancy prices.</p>

<p>But at last the Hamburg grapes, which were late
in 1907 and 1908, began to arrive from Belgium, the
Channel Islands, and England, and the prices suddenly
fell. By the end of May the Belgian Hamburgs fetched
only from 10d. to 1s. 4d. the pound, and the prices were
still falling. In June and July the gardeners could only
get from 5d. to 7d., and during the months of September,
October, and November, 1908, the best Guernsey
grapes were quoted at 6d. the pound. Very beautiful
ones fetched only 4d. the pound.</p>

<p>It was only in the first days of November that the
prices went up to 10d. and 1s. 1d. But already, in the
second half of December, the new crop of Colmars
began to pour in from Belgium, and the prices fell to
9d., and even to 6d. per pound about Christmas.</p>

<p>We thus see that, notwithstanding a great demand
for the best hothouse grapes, with big grains and
quite fresh cut, these grapes are sold in the autumn
almost at the same prices as grapes grown under the
beautiful sun of the south.</p>

<p>As to the quantities of grapes imported to this
country, the figures are also most instructive. The
average for the three years 1905-1907 was 81,700,000
lbs., representing a value of £2,224,500.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_T">T.&mdash;THE USE OF ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE.</h3>

<p>In the first editions of this book I did not venture
to speak about the improvements that could be ob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span>tained
in agriculture with the aid of electricity, or by
watering the soil with cultures of certain useful
microbes. I preferred to mention only well-established
facts of intensive culture; but now it would be impossible
not to mention what has been done in these
two directions.</p>

<p>More than thirty years ago I mentioned in <cite>Nature</cite>
the increase of the crops obtained by a Russian landlord
who used to place at a certain height above his
experimental field telegraph wires, through which an
electric current was passed. A few years ago, in
1908, Sir Oliver Lodge gave in the <cite>Daily Chronicle</cite> of
July 15 the results of similar experiments made in a
farm near Evesham by Messrs. Newman and Bomford,
with the aid of Sir Oliver Lodge’s son, Mr. Lionel Lodge.</p>

<p>A series of thin wires was placed above an experimental
field at distances of ten yards from each
other. These wires were attached to telegraph poles,
high enough not to stand in the way of the carts loaded
with corn. Another field was cultivated by the side
of the former, in order to ascertain what would be the
crops obtained without the aid of electricity.</p>

<p>The poles, five yards high, were placed far away
from each other, so that the wires were quite loose.
Owing to the high tension of the currents that had to
be passed through the wires, the insulators on the poles
were very powerful. The currents were positive and
of a high potential&mdash;about 100,000 volts. The escape
of electricity under these conditions was so great that it
could be seen in the dark. One could also feel it on
the hair and the face while passing under the wires.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the expenditure of electric force was
small, Sir Oliver Lodge writes; because, if the potential
was high, the quantity of consumed energy was, notwithstanding
that, very small. It is known, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span>
that this is also the case with the discharges of atmospheric
electricity, which are terrible in consequence
of their high tension, but do not represent a great loss
of energy. An oil motor of two horse-power was
therefore quite sufficient.</p>

<p>The results were very satisfactory. The wheat crop
in the electrified field was, in the years 1906-1907, by
29 to 40 per cent. greater, and also of better quality,
than in the non-electrified field. The straw was also
from four to eight inches longer.</p>

<p>For strawberries the increase of the crop was 35 per
cent., and 25 per cent. for beetroot.</p>

<p>As to the inoculation of useful microbes by means of
watering the soil with cultures of nitrifying bacteria,
experiments on a great scale have been made in Prussia
upon some peat-bogs. The German agricultural papers
speak of these experiments as having given most satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>Most interesting results have also been obtained in
Germany by heating the soil with a mixture of air and
hot steam passed along the ordinary draining tubes.
A society has been formed to propagate this system,
and the photographs of the results published by the
Society in a pamphlet, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gartenkultur, Bodenheizung,
Klimaverbesserung</cite> (Berlin, 1906), seem to prove that
with a soil thus heated the growth of certain vegetables
is accelerated to some extent.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_U">U.&mdash;PETTY TRADES IN THE LYONS REGION.</h3>

<p>The neighbourhoods of St. Etienne are a great
centre for all sorts of industries, and among them the
petty trades occupy still an important place. Ironworks
and coal-mines with their smoking chimneys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span>
noisy factories, roads blackened with coal, and a poor
vegetation give the country the well-known aspects of
a “Black Country.” In certain towns, such as St.
Chamond, one finds numbers of big factories in which
thousands of women are employed in the fabrication
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passementerie</i>. But side by side with the great
industry the petty trades also maintain a high development.
Thus we have first the fabrication of silk
ribbons, in which no less than 50,000 men and women
were employed in the year 1885. Only 3,000 or 4,000
looms were located then in the factories; while the
remainder&mdash;that is, from 1,200 to 1,400 looms&mdash;belonged
to the workers themselves, both at St.
Etienne and in the surrounding country.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> As a rule
the women and the girls spin the silk or make the
winding off, while the father with his sons weave the
ribbons. I saw these small workshops in the suburbs
of St. Etienne, where complicated ribbons (with interwoven
addresses of the manufacture), as well as ribbons
of high artistic finish, were woven in three to four
looms, while in the next room the wife prepared the
dinner and attended to household work.</p>

<p>There was a time when the wages were high in the
ribbon trade (reaching over ten francs a day), and
M. Euvert wrote me that half of the suburban houses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[456]</span>
of St. Etienne had been built by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passementiers</i>
themselves. But the affairs took a very gloomy aspect
when a crisis broke out in 1884. No orders were
forthcoming, and the ribbon weavers had to live on
casual earnings. All their economies were soon spent.
“How many,” M. Euvert wrote, “have been compelled
to sell for a few hundred francs the loom for which
they had paid as many thousand francs.” What an
effect this crisis has had on the trade I could not say,
as I have no recent information about this region.
Very probably a great number of the ribbon weavers
have emigrated to St. Etienne, where artistic weaving
is continued, while the cheapest sorts of ribbon must
be made in factories.</p>

<p>The manufacture of arms occupies from 5,000 to
6,000 workers, half of whom are in St. Etienne, and
the remainder in the neighbouring county. All work
is done in small workshops, save in the great arm
factory of the State, which sometimes will employ
from 10,000 to 15,000 persons, and sometimes only a
couple of thousand men.</p>

<p>Another important trade in the same region is the
manufacture of hardware, which is all made in small
workshops, in the neighbourhoods of St. Etienne, Le
Chambon, Firminy, Rive de Giers, and St. Bonnet le
Château. The work is pretty regular, but the earnings
are low as a rule. And yet the peasants continue to
keep to those trades, as they cannot go on without
some industrial occupation during part of the
year.</p>

<p>The yearly production of silk stuffs in France attained
no less than 7,558,000 kilogrammes in 1881;<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and
most of the 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 kilogrammes of raw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[457]</span>
silk which were manufactured in the Lyons region were
manufactured by hand.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Twenty years before&mdash;that
is, about 1865&mdash;there were only from 6,000 to 8,000
power-looms, and when we take into account both the
prosperous period of the Lyons silk industry about
1876, and the crisis which it underwent in 1880-1886,
we cannot but wonder about the slowness of the transformation
of the industry. Such is also the opinion of
the President of the Lyons Chamber of Commerce,
who wrote me that the domain of the power-loom is
increased every year, “by including new kinds of
stuffs, which formerly were reputed as unfeasible in
the power-looms; but,” he added, “the transformation
of small workshops into factories still goes on so slowly
that the total number of power-looms reaches only from
20,000 to 25,000 out of an aggregate of from 100,000
to 110,000.” (Since that time it certainly must have
considerably increased.)</p>

<p>The leading features of the Lyons silk industry are
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The preparatory work&mdash;winding off, warping and so
on&mdash;is mostly made in small workshops, chiefly at
Lyons, with only a few workshops of the kind in the
villages. Dyeing and finishing are also made&mdash;of
course, in great factories&mdash;and it is especially in dyeing,
which occupies 4,000 to 5,000 hands, that the Lyons
manufacturers have attained their highest repute.
Not only silks are dyed there, but also cottons and
wools, and not only for France, but also to some
extent for London, Manchester, Vienna, and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[458]</span>
Moscow. It is also in this branch that the best
machines have to be mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>As to the weaving, it is made, as we just saw, on
from 20,000 to 25,000 power-looms and from 75,000
to 90,000 hand-looms, which partly are at Lyons
(from 15,000 to 18,000 hand-looms in 1885) and chiefly
in the villages. The workshops, where one might
formerly find several <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compagnons</i> employed by one
master, have a tendency to disappear, the workshops
mostly having now but from two to three hand-looms,
on which the father, the mother, and the children are
working together. In each house, in each storey of
the Croix Rousse, you find until now such small workshops.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fabricant</i> gives the general indications as
to the kind of stuff he desires to be woven, and his
draughtsmen design the pattern, but it is the workman
himself who must find the way to weave in threads of
all colours the patterns sketched on paper. He thus
continually creates something new; and many improvements
and discoveries have been made by workers
whose very names remain unknown.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>The Lyons weavers have retained until now the
character of being the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of their trade in higher
artistic work in silk stuffs. The finest, really artistic
brocades, satins and velvets, are woven in the smallest
workshops, where one or two looms only are kept.
Unhappily the unsettled character of the demand for
such a high style of work is often a cause of misery
amongst them. In former times, when the orders for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span>
higher sorts of silks became scarce, the Lyons weavers
resorted to the manufacture of stuffs of lower qualities:
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foulards</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crêpes</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tulles</i>, of which Lyons had the monopoly
in Europe. But now the commoner kinds of goods are
manufactured by the million, on the one side by the
factories of Lyons, Saxony, Russia, and Great Britain,
and on the other side by peasants in the neighbouring
departments of France, as well as in the Swiss villages
of the cantons of Basel and Zurich, and in the villages
of the Rhine provinces, Italy, and Russia.</p>

<p>The emigration of the French silk industry from
the towns to the villages began long ago&mdash;that is,
about 1817&mdash;but it was especially in the ’sixties that
this movement took a great development. About the
year 1872 nearly 90,000 hand-looms were scattered,
not only in the Rhône department, but also in those
of Ain, Isère, Loire, Saône-et-Loire, and even those
of Drôme, Ardèche, and Savoie. Sometimes the looms
were supplied by the merchants, but most of them
were bought by the weavers themselves, and it was
especially women and girls who worked on them at
the hours free from agriculture. But already since
1835 the emigration of the silk industry from the city
to the villages began in the shape of great factories
erected in the villages, and such factories continue
to spread in the country, making terrible havoc amidst
the rural populations.</p>

<p>When a new factory is built in a village it attracts
at once the girls, and partly also the boys of the neighbouring
peasantry. The girls and boys are always
happy to find an independent livelihood which emancipates
them from the control of the family. Consequently,
the wages of the factory girls are extremely
low. At the same time the distance from the village
to the factory being mostly great, the girls cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span>
return home every day, the less so as the hours of
labour are usually long. So they stay all the week
at the factory, in barracks, and they only return home
on Saturday evening; while at sunrise on Monday
a waggon makes the tour of the villages, and brings
them back to the factory. Barrack life&mdash;not to
mention its moral consequences&mdash;soon renders the
girls quite unable to work in the fields. And, when
they are grown up, they discover that they cannot
maintain themselves at the low wages offered by the
factory; but they can no more return to peasant life.
It is easy to see what havoc the factory is thus doing
in the villages, and how unsettled is its very existence,
based upon the very low wages offered to country
girls. It destroys the peasant home, it renders the
life of the town worker still more precarious on account
of the competition it makes to him; and the trade
itself is in a perpetual state of unsettledness.</p>

<p>Some information about the present state of the
small industries in this region will be found in the text;
but, unfortunately, we have no modern description of
the industrial life of the Lyons region, which we might
compare with the above.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_V">V.&mdash;SMALL INDUSTRIES AT PARIS.</h3>

<p>It would be impossible to enumerate here all the
varieties of small industries which are carried on at
Paris; nor would such an enumeration be complete,
because every year new industries are brought into
life. I therefore will mention only a few of the most
important industries.</p>

<p>A great number of them are connected, of course,
with ladies’ dress. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confections</i>&mdash;that is, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[461]</span>
making of various parts of ladies’ dress&mdash;occupy no
less than 22,000 operatives at Paris, and their production
attains £3,000,000 every year, while gowns
give occupation to 15,000 women, whose annual production
is valued at £2,400,000. Linen, shoes, gloves,
and so on, are as many important branches of the
petty trades and the Paris domestic industries, while
one-fourth part of the stays which are sewn in France
(£500,000 out of £2,000,000) are made in Paris.</p>

<p>Engraving, book-binding, and all kinds of fancy
stationery, as well as the manufacture of musical
and mathematical instruments, are again as many
branches in which the Paris workmen excel. Basket-making
is another very important item, the finest
sorts only being made in Paris, while the plainest sorts
are made in the centres mentioned in the text (Haute
Marne, Aisne, etc.). Brushes are also made in small
workshops, the trade being valued at £800,000 both at
Paris and in the neighbouring department of Oise.</p>

<p>For furniture, there are at Paris as many as 4,340
workshops, in which three or four operatives per
workshop are employed on the average. In the
watch trade we find 2,000 workshops with only 6,000
operatives, and their production, about £1,000,000,
reaches nevertheless nearly one-third part of the total
watch production in France. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maroquinerie</i> gives
the very high figure of £500,000, although it employs
only 1,000 persons, scattered in 280 workshops, this
high figure itself testifying to the high artistic value
of the Paris leather fancy goods. The jewelry, both
for articles of luxury, and for all descriptions of cheap
goods, is again one of the specialities of the Paris
petty trades; and another well-known speciality is
the fabrication of artificial flowers. Finally, we must
mention the carriage and saddlery trades, which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[462]</span>
carried on in the small towns round Paris; the making
of fine straw hats; glass cutting, and painting on glass
and china; and numerous workshops for fancy buttons,
attire in mother-of-pearl, and small goods in horn and
bone.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_W">W.&mdash;RESULTS OF THE CENSUS OF THE FRENCH INDUSTRIES IN 1896.</h3>

<p>If we consult the results of the census of 1896,
that were published in 1901, in the fourth volume of
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Résultats statistiques du recensement des industries et des
professions</cite>, preceded by an excellent summary written
by M. Lucien March, we find that the general impression
about the importance of the small industries
in France conveyed in the text is fully confirmed by
the numerical data of the census.</p>

<p>It is only since 1896, M. March says in a paper
read before the Statistical Society of Paris, that a
detailed classification of the workshops and factories
according to the number of their operatives became
possible;<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and he gives us in this paper, in a series
of very elaborate tables, a most instructive picture of
the present state of industry in France.</p>

<p>For the industries proper&mdash;including the industries
carried on by the State and the Municipalities, but
excluding the transport trades&mdash;the results of the census
can be summed up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is, first of all, an important division of “heads
of establishments (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patrons</i>) working alone, independent
artisans, and working-men without a permanent employment,”
which contains 1,530,000 persons. It has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[463]</span>
a very mixed character, as we find here, in agriculture,
the small farmer, who works for himself; and the
labourer, who works by the day for occasional farmers;
and in industry the head of a small workshop, who
works for himself (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patron-ouvrier</i>); the working-man,
who on the day of the census had no regular employment;
the dressmaker, who works sometimes in her own
room and sometimes in a shop; and so on. It is only in
an indirect way that M. March finds out that this division
contains, in its industrial part, nearly 483,000 artisans
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patrons-ouvriers</i>); and independent working-men and
women; and about 1,047,000 persons of both sexes,
temporarily attached to some industrial establishment.</p>

<p>There are, next, 37,705 industrial establishments, of
which the heads employ no hired workmen, but are
aided by one or more members of their own families.</p>

<p>We have thus, at least, 520,000 workshops belonging
to the very small industry.</p>

<p>Next to them come 575,530 workshops and factories,
giving occupation to more than 3,000,000 persons.
They constitute the bulk of French industry, and their
subdivision into small, middle-sized, and great industry
is what interests us at this moment.</p>

<p>The most striking point is the immense number of
establishments having only from one to ten working-men
each. No less than 539,449 such workshops and
factories have been tabulated, which makes 94 per cent.
of all the industrial establishments in France; and we find
in them more than one-third of all workpeople of both
sexes engaged in industry&mdash;namely, 1,134,700 persons.</p>

<p>Next comes the class, still very numerous (28,626
establishments and 585,000 operatives), where we find
only from eleven to fifty workmen per establishment.
Nearly two-thirds of these small factories (17,342
establishments, 240,000 workmen) are so small that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[464]</span>
they give occupation to less than twenty persons each.
They thus belong still to the small industry.</p>

<p>After that comes a sudden fall in the figures. There
are only 3,865 factories having from fifty-one to 100 employees.
This class and the preceding one contain
among them 5½ per cent. of all the industrial establishments,
and 27½ per cent. of their employees.</p>

<p>The class of factories employing from 101 to 500
workmen contains 3,145 establishments (616,000
workmen and other employees). But that of from
501 to 1,000 employees per factory has only 295
establishments, and a total of only 195,000 operatives.
Taken together, these two classes contain less than
1 per cent. of all the establishments (six per 1,000),
and 26 per cent. of all the workmen.</p>

<p>Finally, the number of factories and works having
more than a thousand workmen and employees each is
very small. It is only 149. Out of them, 108 have from
1,001 to 2,000 workmen, twenty-one have from 2,001
to 5,000, and ten only have more than 5,000 workmen.
These 149 very big factories and works give occupation
to 313,000 persons only, out of more than 3,000,000&mdash;that
is, only 10 per cent. of all the industrial workers.</p>

<p>It thus appears that more than 99 per cent. of all
the industrial establishments in France&mdash;that is,
571,940 out of 575,529&mdash;have less than 100 workmen
each. They give occupation to 2,000,000 persons, and
represent an army of 571,940 employers. More than
that. The immense majority of that number (568,075
employers) belong to the category of those who employ
less than fifty workmen each. And I do not yet count
in their number 520,000 employers and artisans who
work for themselves, or with the aid of a member of
the family.</p>

<p>It is evident that in France, as everywhere, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[465]</span>
petty trades represent a very important factor of the
industrial life. Economists have been too hasty in
celebrating their death. And this conclusion becomes
still more apparent when one analyses the different
industries separately, taking advantage of the tables
given in <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Résultats Statistiques</cite>. A very important fact
appears from this analysis&mdash;namely, that there are
only three branches of industry in which one can speak
of a strong “concentration”&mdash;the mines, metallurgy,
and the State’s industries, to which one may add the
textiles and ironmongery, but always remembering that
in these two branches immense numbers of small factories
continue to prosper by the side of the great ones.</p>

<p>In all other branches the small trades are dominant,
to such an extent that more than <em>95 per cent. of the
employers employ less than fifty workmen each</em>. In the
quarries, in all branches of the alimentation, in the
book trade, clothing, leather, wood, metallic goods,
and even the brick-works, china and glass works, we
hardly find one or two factories out of each hundred
employing more than fifty workmen.</p>

<p>The three industries that make an exception to this
rule are, we have said, metallurgy, the great works of
the State, and the mines. In metallurgy two-thirds
of the works have more than fifty men each, and it is
here that we find some twenty great works employing
each of them more than one thousand men. The works
of the State, which include the great shipbuilding
yards, are evidently in the same case. They contain
thirty-four establishments, having more than 500 men
each, and fourteen employing more than 1,000. And
finally, in the mines&mdash;one hardly would believe that&mdash;more
than one-half of all establishments employ less
than fifty workmen each; but 15 per cent. of them
have more than 500 workmen; forty-one mines are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[466]</span>
worked by a staff of more than 1,000 persons each, and
six out of them employ even more than 5,000 miners.</p>

<p>It is only in these three branches that one finds a
rather strong “concentration”; and yet, the small
industry continues to exist, as we saw it already in
England, by the side of the great one, even in mining,
and still more so in all branches of metallurgy.</p>

<p>As to the <em>textile</em> industries, they have exactly the
same character as in England. We find here a certain
number of very large establishments (forty establishments
having each of them more than 1,000 workpeople),
and especially we see a great development
of the middle-sized factories (1,300 mills having from
100 to 500 workpeople). But on the other side, the small
industry is also very numerous.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Quite the same is also seen in the manufacture of all
<em>metallic goods</em> (iron, steel, brass). Here, also, by the
side of a few great works (seventeen works occupy each
of them more than 1,000 workpeople and salaried
employees; out of them five employ more than
2,000 persons, and one more than 5,000); and by the
side of a great number of middle-sized works (440
establishments employing from 100 to 500 persons),
we find more than 100,000 artisans who work single-handed,
or with the aid of their families; and 72,600
works which have only from three to four workpeople.</p>

<p>In the <em>india-rubber</em> works, and those for the manufacture
of <em>paper</em>, the middle-sized factories are still
well represented (13 per cent. of all the establishments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[467]</span>
have more than fifty workmen each); but the remainder
belongs to the small industry. It is the same
in the <em>chemical works</em>. There is in this branch some
ten factories employing more than 500 persons, and
100 which employ from 101 to 500 people; but the
remainder is 1,000 of small works employing from
ten to fifty people, and 3,800 of the very small works
(less than ten workers).</p>

<p>In all other branches it is <em>the small or the very
small industry</em> which dominates. Thus, in the manufacture
of articles of food, there are only eight factories
employing more than 500 people each, and 92,000
small establishments having less than ten workpeople
each. In the printing industry the immense majority
of establishments are very small, and employ from
five to ten, or from ten to fifty workpeople.</p>

<p>As to the manufacture of <em>clothing</em>, it entirely belongs
to the small industry. Only five factories employ more
than 200 each; but the remainder represents 630,000
independent artisans, men and women; 9,500 workshops
where the work is done by the family; and
132,000 workshops and factories occupying less than
ten workpeople each.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The different branches dealing with straw, feathers,
hair, leather, gloves, again, belong to the small and the
very small industry: 125,000 artisans and 43,000
small establishments employing from three to four
persons each.</p>

<p>Shall I speak of the factories dealing with wood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[468]</span>
furniture, brushes, and so on? True, there are in these
branches two large factories employing nearly 2,000
persons; but there are also 214,260 independent artisans
and 105,400 small factories and workshops employing
less than ten persons each.</p>

<p>Needless to say that jewelry, the cutting of precious
stones, and stone-cutting for masonry belong entirely
to the small industry, no more than ten to twenty
works employing more than 100 persons each. Only
in ceramics and in brick-making do we find by the
side of the very small works (8,930 establishments),
and the small ones (1,277 establishments employing
from ten to fifty workpeople), 334 middle-sized works
(fifty to 200 workpeople), ninety-three of the great
industry (201 to 1,000), and seven of the very great
(more than 1,000 workpeople).<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_X">X.&mdash;THE SMALL INDUSTRIES IN GERMANY.</h3>

<p>The literature of the small industries in Germany
being very bulky, the chief works upon this subject may
be found, either in full or reviewed, in Schmoller’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[469]</span>
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrbücher</cite>, and in Conrad’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sammlung national-ökonomischer
und statistischer Abhandlungen</cite>. For a general
review of the subject and rich bibliographical indications,
Schönberg’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volkwirthschaftslehre</cite>, vol. ii., which
contains excellent remarks about the proper domain
of small industries (p. 401 <em>seq.</em>), as well as the above-mentioned
publication of K. Bücher (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Untersuchungen
über die Lage des Handwerks in Deutschland</cite>), will be
found most valuable. The work of O. Schwarz, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die
Betriebsformen der modernen Grossindustrie</cite> (in <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift
für Staatswissenschaft</cite>, vol. xxv., p. 535), is
interesting by its analysis of the respective advantages
of both the great and the small industries, which
brings the author to formulate the following three
factors in favour of the former: (1) economy in the
cost of motive power; (2) division of labour and its
harmonic organisation; and (3) the advantages offered
for the sale of the produce. Of these three factors, the
first is more and more eliminated every year by the
progress achieved in the transmission of power; the
second exists in small industries as well, and to the
same extent, as in the great ones (watchmakers, toy-makers,
and so on); so that only the third remains
in full force; but this factor, as already mentioned
in the text of this book, is a <em>social</em> factor which entirely
depends upon the degree of development of the spirit
of association amongst the producers.</p>

<p>A detailed industrial census having been taken in
1907, in addition to those of 1882 and 1895, most
important and quite reliable data showing the importance
and the resistance of the small industries were
brought to light, and a series of most interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[470]</span>
monographs dealing with this subject have been
published. Let me name, therefore, some of those
which could be consulted with profit: Dr. Fr. Zahn,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wirtschaftliche Entwicklung, unter besonderer Berücksichtigung
der Volkszählung</cite>, 1905, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">sowie der Berufs
und Betriebszählung</cite>, 1907; <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sonderabdruck aus der
Annalen des Deutschen Reichs</cite>, München, 1910 and
1911; Dr. Josef Grunzel, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">System der Industriepolitik</cite>,
Leipzig, 1905; and <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Sieg des Industrialismus</cite>,
Leipzig, 1911; W. Sombart, “Verlagssystem
(Hausindustrie)”, in Conrad, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Handwörterbuch der
Staatswissenschaften</cite>, 3te Auflage, Bd. VIII.; R. van
der Borght, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beruf, Gesellschaftliche Gliederung und
Betrieb im Deutschen Reiche</cite>, in <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vorträge der Gehe-Stiftung</cite>,
Bd. II., 1910; and Heinrich Koch, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die
Deutsche Hausindustrie</cite>, M. Gladbach, 1905. Many
other works will be found mentioned by these authors.</p>

<p>In all these books the reader will find a further
confirmation of the ideas about the small industries
that are expressed in chapters vi. and vii. When I
developed them in the first edition of this book, it
was objected to me that, although the existence of a
great number of small industries is out of question,
and although their great extension in a country so
far advanced in its industrial development as England
was not known to economists, still the fact proves
nothing. These industries are a mere survival; and
if we had data about the different classes of industry
<em>at different periods</em>, we should see how rapidly the
small industries are disappearing.</p>

<p>Now we have such data for Germany, for a period
of twenty-five years, in the three censuses of 1882,
1895, and 1907, and, what is still more valuable, these
twenty-five years belong to a moment in the life of
Germany when a powerful industry has developed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[471]</span>
an immense scale with a great rapidity. Here it is
that the dying out of the small industries, their “absorption”
by the great concerns, and the supposed
“concentration of capital” ought to be seen in full.</p>

<p>But the numerical results, as they appear from the
three censuses, and as they have been interpreted
by those who have studied them, are pointing out to
quite the reverse. The position of the small industries
in the life of an industrial country is exactly
the same which could have been foreseen twenty-five
years ago, and very often it is described in the very
same words that I have used.</p>

<p>The German <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Statistisches Jahrbuch</cite> gives us the distribution
of workmen in the different industries of the
German Empire in 1882 and 1895. Leaving aside all
the concerns which belong to trade and those for the
sale of alcoholic drinks (955,680 establishments,
2,165,638 workpeople), as also 42,321 establishments
belonging to horticulture, fishing, and poultry (103,128
workpeople in 1895), there were, in all the industries,
including mining, 1,237,000 artisans working single-handed,
and over 900,000 establishments in which
6,730,500 persons were employed. Their distribution
in establishments of different sizes was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>What appears quite distinctly from the last census
is the rapid decrease in the numbers of artisans who
work single-handed, mostly without the aid of
machinery. Such an individual mode of production
by hand is naturally on the decrease, even many
artisans resorting now to some sort of motive power and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[473]</span>
taking one or two hired aids; but this does not prove
in the least that the small industries carried on with
the aid of machinery should be on the wane. The
census of 1907 proves quite the contrary, and all
those who have studied it are bound to recognise it.</p>

<p>“Of a pronounced decay of the small establishments
in which five or less persons are employed, is, of
course, no sign,” writes Dr. Zahn in the afore-mentioned
work. Out of the 14·3 million people who live
on industry, full 5·4 million belong to the small
industry.</p>

<p>Far from decreasing, this category has considerably
increased since 1895 (from 732,572 establishments
with 1,954,125 employees in 1895, to 875,518 establishments
and 2,205,539 employees in 1907). Moreover,
it is not only the very small industry which is on the
increase; it is also the small one which has increased
even more than the preceding&mdash;namely, by 47,615
establishments and 812,139 employees.</p>

<p>As to the very great industry, a closer analysis of
what the German statisticians describe as giant
establishments (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Riesenbetriebe</i>) shows that they belong
chiefly to industries working for the State, or created
in consequence of State-granted monopolies. Thus,
for instance, the Krupp Shareholders Company employ
69,500 persons in their nine different establishments,
and everyone knows that the works of Krupp are in
reality a dependency of the State.</p>

<p>The opinions of the above-named German authors
about the facts revealed by the industrial censuses
are very interesting.</p>

<p>In speaking of the small industries in Germany,
W. Sombart writes in the article, “Verlagssystem
(Hausindustrie),” in Conrad’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de"><ins class="corr" id="tn-473" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Handwörtezbuch'">
Handwörterbuch</ins></cite>: “It
results from the census of 1907 that the losses in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[474]</span>
small industries are almost exclusively limited to those
home industries which are usually described as the
<i>old ones</i>; while the increases belong to the home
industries of modern origin.” The statistical data
thus confirm that “at the present time a sort of
rejuvenation is going on in the home industries; instead
of those of them which are dying out, new ones,
almost equal in numbers, are growing up” (p. 242).
Prof. Sombart points out that the same is going on in
Switzerland, and refers to some new works on this
subject.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Dr. J. Grunzel comes to a similar conclusion: “Life
experience shows that the home industries are not a
form of industrial organisation which has had its
time,” he writes in his afore-mentioned work. “On
the contrary, it proves to be possessed of a great life
force in certain branches. It is spread in all branches
in which handwork offers advantages above the
work of the machine” (p. 46). It is also retained
wherever the value of labour exceeds very much the
value of the raw produce; and finally, in all the
branches devoted to articles which are rapidly changing
with the seasons or the vagaries of fashion. And
he shows (pp. 46 and 149) how the home industries have
been increasing in Germany from 1882 to 1895, and
how they are widely spread in Austria, France, Switzerland,
Italy, Belgium, and England.</p>

<p>The conclusions of R. van der Borght are quite
similar.</p>

<p>“It is true,” Dr. van der Borght says, “that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[475]</span>
numbers of artisans working single-handed have
diminished in numbers in most industries; but they
still represent two-fifths of all industrial establishments,
and even more than one-half in several industries.
At the same time, the small establishments (having
from one to five workers) have increased in numbers,
and they contain nearly one-half of all the industrial
establishments, and even more than that in several
groups.”</p>

<p>As for Koch’s work, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Deutsche Hausindustrie</cite>, it
deserves special mention for the discussion it contains
of the measures advocated, on the one side, for the
weeding out of the domestic industries, and, on the
other side, for improving the condition of the workers
and the industries themselves by the means of co-operation,
credit, workshops’ inspection, and the like.</p>


<h3 class="fs120" id="APP_Y">Y.&mdash;THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES IN SWITZERLAND.</h3>

<p>We have most interesting monographs dealing with
separate branches of the small industries of Switzerland,
but we have not yet such comprehensive statistical data
as those which have been mentioned in the text in
speaking of Germany and France. It was only in the
year 1901 that the first attempt was made to get the
exact numbers of workpeople employed in what the
Swiss statisticians describe as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hausindustrie</i>, or “the
domestic industries’ extension of the factory industries”
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der hausindustrielle Anhang der Fabrikindustrie</i>).
Up till then these numbers remained “an absolutely
unknown quantity.” For many it was, therefore, a
revelation when a first rough estimate, made by the
factory inspectors, gave the figure of 52,291 work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[476]</span>people
belonging to this category, as against 243,200
persons employed in all the factories, large and small,
of the same branches. A few years later, Schuler,
in <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitung für Schweizerische Statistik</cite>, 1904 (reprinted
since as a volume), came to the figure of 131,299 persons
employed in the domestic industries; and yet
this figure, although it is much nearer to reality than
the former, is still below the real numbers. Finally, an
official census of the industries, made in 1905, gave the
figure of 92,162 persons employed in the domestic
industries in 70,873 establishments, in the following
branches&mdash;textiles, watches and jewellery, straw-plaiting,
clothing and dress, wood-carving, tobacco. They
thus represent more than one-fourth (28·5 per cent.)
of the 317,027 operatives employed in Switzerland in
these same branches, and 15·7 per cent. of all the
industrial operatives, who numbered 585,574 in 1905.</p>

<p>Out of the just-mentioned 92,162 workpeople, registered
as belonging to the domestic trades, nearly
three-quarters (66,061 in 49,168 establishments) belong
to the textile industry, chiefly knitting and the silks;
then comes the watch-trade (12,871 persons in 9,186
establishments), straw-plaiting, and dress. However,
these figures are still incomplete. Not only
several smaller branches of the domestic trades were
omitted in the census, but also the children under
fourteen years of age employed in the domestic trades,
whose numbers are estimated at 32,300, were not
counted. Besides, the census having been made in the
summer, during the “strangers’ season,” a considerable
number of persons employed in a variety of domestic
trades during the winter did not appear in the census.</p>

<p>It must also be noted that the Swiss census includes
under the name of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heimarbeit</i> (domestic trades) only
those “dependencies of the industrial employers” which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[477]</span>
do not represent separate factories placed under the
employer’s management; so that those workshops and
small factories, the produce of which is sold directly to
the consumers, as also the small factories directly
managed by small employers, are not included in this
category. If all that be taken into consideration, we
must agree with the conclusion that the “domestic
trades have in Switzerland a much greater extension
than in any other country of Europe” (save Russia),
which we find in an elaborate recent work, published in
connection with the 1910 exhibition of Swiss domestic
industries, and edited by Herr Jac. Lorenz (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die wirtschaftlichen
und sozialen Verhältnisse in der Schweizerischen
Heimarbeit</cite>, Zurich, 1910-1911, p. 27).</p>

<p>A feature of importance which appears from this last
work is, that more than one-half of the workers engaged
in domestic trades have some other source of income
besides these trades. Very many of them carry on
agriculture, so that it has been said that in Switzerland
“the domestic trades’ question is as much <em>a peasant
question</em> as a labour question.”</p>

<p>It would be impossible to sum up in this place the
interesting data contained in the first four fascicles
published by Herr Lorenz, which deal with the cotton,
the silk, and the linen domestic industries, their struggles
against the machine, their defeats in some branches
and their holding the ground in other branches, and so
on. I must therefore refer the reader to this very
instructive publication.</p>

President of the Chamber of Commerce of St. Etienne, who
sent me, while I was in the Clairvaux prison, in April, 1885, a
most valuable sketch of the various industries of the region,
in reply to a letter of mine, and I avail myself of the opportunity
for expressing to M. Euvert my best thanks for his courtesy.
This information has now an historical value only. But it is
such an interesting page of the history of the small industries
that I retain it as it was in the first edition, the more so as it is
most interesting to compare it with the pages given in the text
to the present conditions of the same industries.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
